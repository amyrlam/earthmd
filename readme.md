EarthMD is WebMD meets Quora for hippies. I redid EarthClinic.com, a user-generated folk medicine directory. I absolutely love Earth Clinic because it is the only useful directory of natural remedies I’ve found on the web. However, the site is extremely cumbersome to use. For example, over 300 people agree that gargling water with cayenne pepper is the best cure for a sore throat. But sifting through these testimonials is a huge time suck! Wouldn’t it be cool if Earth Clinic adopted an Amazon-like review system? Just give the most helpful positive and negative review at a glance, while allowing the user to dig deeper if needed.

EarthMD is built using Python, Flask, Postgres and SQLAlchemy. I tried scraping the original site using PyQuery and Beautiful Soup, and chose PyQuery. In displaying data, I touched on JavaScript (jQuery, AJAX), HTML and CSS. Ultimately, I’d like to convince Earth Clinic to let my code be the open-source solution to overhauling their site.
