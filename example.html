If you are going to try apple cider vinegar for allergies, or even to prevent sickness, we suggest you do an investigation of your own by buying a pH test kit at a local pharmacy, garden nursery, or even pool supply store. You can use these kits or pH strips to test your urine to see if you are more alkaline or acid during an allergy attack, virus or bacterial infection. Once you ascertain your pH levels, you can adjust adjust your dosage of Apple Cider Vinegar accordingly.</P>
<P>If you live in a highly polluted area like we do (Los Angeles) where allergies and sinus infections are rampant, your system may better balance itself with a small dose of apple cider vinegar each day. Ultimately we suggest you experiment with a kit to find the pH balance your body functions optimally at. Want to know more about pH?

<P>Our Bangkok contributor Ted tells us, "Apple Cider Vinegar in itself is alkaline because of its "ash" content, which means if the apple cider vinegar was burned, what is left over becomes ash. When you check for the pH of that ash and dissolve it with water, the content is alkaline. Whenever our body digests anything, it undergoes oxidation, which is similar to burning and the end result is that you can determine whether the end product was alkaline or acid. Apple Cider Vinegar has anti-fungal, anti-bacterial, and anti-viral properties, primarily coming from the malic acid and acetic acid portion of the vinegar. Apple cider vinegar acts as a buffer in the body because the acetic acid reacts with base or acid compounds to form an acetate, therefore rendering them chemically bioavailable for the body's utilization. Additionally, Apple Cider Vinegar can reduce the toxicity of certain compounds by converting the toxin into an acetate compound, which is less toxic. This is why they are ideal for insect bites and certain skin allergies. While Apple Cider vinegar in itself is considered alkaline, a chemically pure vinegar (acetic acid) is neither acid nor basic forming as it leaves no ash as the entire portion, when burned evaporates completely.

07/08/2009: Sean from Asheville, NC replies: "Hey Ted, Thank you for prompting my curiosity. My understanding was that during digestion of acids the buffering process requires not only enzymes but also minerals to convert the acids before they can be considered anything but acidic. In my mind apple cider vinegar (ACV), and all vinegars, are acidic and that not until they are metabolized are they alkaline.

I haven't found one so far so I am going to get it out there and see if anyone has some insight on the matter. I drink apple cider vinegar throughout the morning mixed with warm water and honey. I have read that the vinegar itself helps balance the body's pH levels. The vinegar itself is alkaline, however I mix mine with honey which from what I have also read can make the body acidic, I'm guessing from the sugar content.. My question is will the honey cancel out the vinegar regarding the pH balancing? I know the two products can do wonders for health and all, but I'm curious to know if they could also be working against each other with pH in mind. Thanks to all who may have some thought on this."</blockquote>		<blockquote><div style="height:15px;"></div>

I have a large square footage shop and have no idea where the pockets of infestation are. By taking cotton balls and soaking them with Permetherin available at REI (known to kill mites) and allowing cotton to completely dry, the cotton is placed in the mice cage where the mouse will use it to burrow a nest. I had a real problem ethically with this "sacrificial lamb" idea until I discovered the Permetherin. The warmth of the blood of the mice and being at ground level cages will attract the mites, who once exposed to the Permetherin in the cotton balls will perish. It was either this or try to get a 1000 square foot facility up to 140 degrees F, to attain thermal death of mites, and that just did not work. Barely broke 100 deg.</P><P>I hope this helps anyone happening upon my experimentation.

Apple cider vinegar (ACV) is composed of 5% acetic acid with a pH of 3 clearly making vinegar acidic rather than alkaline. The pH would need to be higher than 7 in order for the vinegar to be alkaline and then it would not be vinegar, it would be sodium or potassium acetate and would likely do little for those of us taking it other than possibly elevating blood pressure that might be caused by the increased levels of sodium."</blockquote>		<blockquote><div style="height:15px;"></div>

Since cutting out the apple cider vinegar and taking a zinc capsule I cannot believe how much better I feel. I can exercise again and not be exhausted for days.

<P><STRONG>Vinegar: A Natural Approach to Avian Management<BR>By Wanda Barras</STRONG></P>
<P>"Many herbalists recommend the use of raw, unpasteurized, unheated, organic apple cider vinegar as an important dietary ingredient for humans, farm animals and pets, including birds. The Encyclopedia of Natural Pet Care describes apple cider vinegar in this way: "Long a folk remedy, cider vinegar has been shown to improve the health of dairy cows, horses, dogs and other animals. It reduces common infections, aids whelping, improves stamina, prevents muscle fatigue after exercise, increases resistance to disease and protects against food poisoning. Cider vinegar is rich in the vitamins, minerals and trace elements found in apples, especially potassium; it normalizes acid levels [pH] in the stomach, improves digestion and the assimilation of nutrients, reduces intestinal and fecal odors, helps cure constipation, alleviates some of the symptoms of arthritis and helps prevent bladder stones and urinary tract infections."</P>
<P><STRONG>Vinegar Through The Ages</STRONG></P>
<P>Vinegar has been used to cure ailments for centuries. For hundreds of years, folk medicine practitioners have recommended daily doses of apple cider vinegar, not only for specific medical problems, but also for overall food health. In Asia vinegar is called the friend of Chinese herbs because it is often used to process herbal preparations. It is also successfully used in modern Chinese medicine.</P>
<P>Historically, the origin of vinegar was never specifically noted. Vinegar was probably discovered when one of our ancestors found that wine exposed to the air would turn sour, thereby creating vinegar. It is amongst the oldest of foods and medicines know to man. For its healing ways, vinegar has been used for thousands of years. In 400 B.C, Hypocrites, known as the father of medicine, treated patients with vinegar, making it one of the world's first medicines. Throughout biblical times, vinegar was successfully used to treat infections and wounds. For centuries medical textbooks have listed various ways to use vinegar. These uses include everything from keeping a sharp mind to purifying the waters of the body and to easing pain and alleviating dozens of other ailments. Modern laboratory analysis verifies the antibacterial and antiseptic properties of vinegar. Many of the old-time uses are just as applicable now as they were centuries ago. (Moore xii)</P>
<P><STRONG>Natural Apple Cider Vinegar: One of Mother Nature's Most Perfect Foods</STRONG></P>
<P>Fermenting sweet juice makes vinegar. The juice turns to wine or cider which is allowed to ferment a second time until the alcohol mixes with oxygen in the air, changing it into acetic acid and water. Natural---that is, undistilled, organic, raw, apple cider vinegar is often called one of Mother Nature's most perfect foods. Apple cider vinegar should be made from fresh, organic, crushed apples that are allowed to mature naturally in wooden barrels. Natural apple cider vinegar, found in health food stores, should be a rich amber color with the "mother" quite visible as sentiment on the bottom. The strength of vinegar is important. All varieties of vinegar contain about 4 to 7 percent acetic acid, with 5 percent being the most common amount. Acetic acid is what gives vinegar its tart and sour taste.</P>
<P>There is nothing beneficial about commercial distilled vinegars except for pickling, cleaning and disinfection ---they have no health value! They do not contain the health values of organic, raw apple cider vinegar with the mother still intact and viable. Distilled white vinegar and cider vinegar sold in supermarkets are considered "dead" vinegars with none of the enzymes and other live factors that make raw, unpasteurized vinegars so valuable. Distilling removes the beneficial "mother" from the vinegar, thereby, destroying the powerful enzymes and life giving minerals such as potassium, phosphorus, natural organic sodium, magnesium, sulphur, iron copper, natural organic fluorine, silicon, trace minerals, pectin and other powerful nutrients. Also destroyed are natural malic and tartaric acids, which are important in fighting body toxins and inhibiting unfriendly bacteria growth (_____ 1- 4).</P>
<P>Apple cider vinegar has shown to be an extremely valuable constituent in the body's biochemical operations and an essential building block in the construction of many complex substances in the body. Vinegar is low in calories and carbohydrates but does contain small amounts of calcium, phosphorus, iron and, of course, lots of potassium. A cup of ACV is 98.8% water, has 34 calories, a trace of protein, and no fat. (Moore p.viii) Acetic acid, the principal constituent in vinegar, plays an important role in the release of energy from fats and carbohydrates. It is of primary importance in the body's metabolism.</P>
<P><STRONG>Apple Cider Vinegar Can Make Any Living Thing Healthier</STRONG></P>
<P>Dr. D.C. Jarvis, MD who wrote "Folk Medicine, A Vermont Doctor's Guide to Good Health" and "Arthritis and Folk Medicine", is completely convinced that apple cider vinegar could make any living thing healthier. He believes, Potassium, which is found in just the right amounts in natural apple cider vinegar "is so essential to the life of every living thing and that with out it there would be no life. Potassium is the most important of all minerals that are necessary for good health." Potassium's main function is to promote cell, tissue and organism growth. It is necessary to replace dead cells and tissue. There is no better source of potassium than vinegar---particularly natural apple cider vinegar.</P>
<P>Dr. Jarvis believes Apple cider vinegar can help fight infection, simply by keeping fluids where they belong---in body cells, not in bacteria. Bacteria need moisture to thrive. As bacteria multiply, they will pull necessary fluids from healthy cells in order to flourish, particularly during times of stress when resistance is low. Stress is a major agent in causing a previously sub-clinical problem to break into a full-blown illness. If the process goes unchecked illness will occur. In order to defeat bacterial infections and illness it is important to keep moisture in the cells and prevent germs from depleting that moisture. According to Dr. Jarvis: "If there is enough potassium in each body cell, it will draw moisture from the [harmful] bacteria, instead of the bacteria taking moisture from the body cells." Therefore by providing natural sources of potassium in the diet (fruit, berries, sprouts, edible leaves, edible roots, etc.) and including apple cider vinegar to that diet the body cells are provided with the necessary moisture-attracting potassium. It is interesting to note that many traditional medicines used to combat bacterial illness also work by depriving bacteria of moisture and thus keeping fluids inside the cells (O'Brien p40)</P>
<P><STRONG>Acidic pH Balance Will Discourage Bacteria, Yeast & Fungal Growth</STRONG></P>
<P>Apple cider vinegar destroys microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, viruses and others, and prevents poisons from reaching the rest of the systems of the body. It has been proven to inhibit the growth of gram-negative bacilli, Pseudomonas, and Candida. The acid nature of vinegar makes the digestive tract environment unpleasant for germs and fungus. Apple cider vinegar has proven to be a natural treatment (and preventative) in simple cases of avian pediatric digestive disorders. Dr. Jarvis through his own research believes that apple cider vinegar will lower bloods natural alkalinity, bringing it closer to a natural healthy acid state. A naturally acidic digestive tract digestive, with the correct pH balance, will discourage bacteria and is less likely to grow yeast and fungus. Apple cider vinegar can assist the natural process of breaking food in the stomach. The acidic qualities of ACV will help break down protein, in the digestive system, for absorption into the bloodstream.</P>
<P><STRONG>Apple Cider Vinegar On The Farm</STRONG></P>
<P>For the past year and a half I have routinely added apple cider vinegar, to my baby birds' hand-feeding formula, to all drinking water and sprinkled some on the food of the animals here at our aviary and small dairy farm. These animals include several species of breeding exotic parrots, chickens, ducks, dogs, cats and LaMancha dairy goats. The vinegar keeps the water bowls and bottles very clean and sanitary and the animals seem to love it--- of course, the nutritional and health benefits are a plus. Apple cider vinegar added to young birds drinking water encourages early weaning and healthy weight gain and they will feather out faster. Adding a little raw apple cider vinegar to the hand-feeding formula water can prove nutritionally beneficial and help to inhibit the growth of yeast, fungus and bacteria. In formula a ratio of about 1/4 tsp per 4 oz water is best.</P>
<P>You may safely add cider vinegar to food and/or drinking water, starting with small amounts and building up to 1/2 to 1 teaspoon per 15 pounds of body weight or about 1 tsp apple cider vinegar (health food store variety best) to 8 oz water. That is about %1/4 cup per gallon of water and/or you may sprinkle or spray small amounts on bird's food. Gradually add small doses to food over time, you can help even the most finicky eater to accept this. Do not use metal food or water dishes when using vinegar, stainless steel is OK.</P>
<P><STRONG>In Conclusion</STRONG></P>
<P>Why Vinegar? Because it can be used medicinally, gets rid of poisons in the body, has disinfecting and cleaning properties and is a natural, nontoxic, biodegradable substance. That is, vinegar is an unadulterated food, a powerful cleansing agent and healing elixir---a naturally occurring antibiotic and antiseptic that fights germs and bacteria. We would be smart to make use of vinegar in our own lives and in our avian nurseries and breeding facilities. --- For a healthier, stronger, longer life for our animals and ourselves.</P>

Hope this helps! :)"</P><P></P><BR><P>01/18/2010: Dandygirl from Newport Beach, Ca replies: "I have suffered from GERD...heartburn/acide reflux etc... for years...have been on medication for years and finally found my cure! I started with digestive enzymes combined with 2 apple cider vinegar pills with EVERY meal...now I ONLY use apple cider vin pills with every meal and I have NO MORE heartburn or acid reflux! I also always keep papaya enzymes to chew on after a heavy meal or anytime between meals! It's like a MIRACLE!!! :o)"</P><P></P><BR><P>01/31/2011: Andrea from Springfield, Missouri Usa replies: "Why not try rinsing your mouth with water or bottled water to get the vinegar off of your teeth so it doesn't ruin the enamel rather than waiting an hour for your ph to return the salivia to normal, because it is probobly just eating the enamel off of your teeth during that hour after taking the ACV."</blockquote><p class="BackToTop"><div class="action-icons"><ul><li><a href="/contactus.php?action=Feedback&pid=1&id=67864&title= Capsules" target="_new" class="ico-reply">Reply</a></li><li><a href="javascript: void(0)" onclick="MM_openBrWindow('/signin.php?st=1&nd=67864','','scrollbars=1,width=400,height=350')" class="ico-watch">Watch</a></li><li><a href="javascript: void(0)" onClick="mailPost('67866', ' Capsules', 'Feedback');" class="ico-email">Email</a></li><li><a href="javascript: void(0)" onClick="printPost('67866', ' Capsules', 'Feedback');" class="ico-print">Print</a></li><li><a href="#top" class="ico-top">To Top</a></li></ul></div></p></div>        <div style="padding-left:30px; padding-right:30px; padding-top:4px; padding-bottom:4px; background-color:#ffffff;">

Now and then I slack off for awhile, but I always come back to it. I have allergies, acid reflux and a weight control problem. I have managed to conquer all three of these issues, plus keep down colds and infections by using ACV on a regular basis. I LOVE the taste. I mix mine in warm water and add a teaspoon of raw honey just to make it a little more palatable. I started doing this at night because that's when my acid reflux is the worst. I was terribly overweight at the time and I noticed my weight started dropping. I was pleased and continued to take it. I am now within 20 lbs of my desired weight and I will get there by using this formula. I mix 1 TBSP apple cider vinegar, 12 oz. warm water, 1 tsp raw honey and I drink it slowly at bedtime. I also have a blood pressure problem that is now completely under control and has been for some time. </P><P>While I do still take medication, I now only take ONE pill daily instead of three different ones twice daily. Apple cider vinegar is one of the best cures I have found and it works no matter how old you are. I was very ill for 8 years before I discovered ACV and its many uses. I started taking it three years ago and I am amazed at the difference in my energy level, my ability to move around, my quality of life in general and my overall health. My doctor is even more amazed. I also take a tablespoon of bee pollen every morning for my vitamins, but that's another story altogether. I encourage anyone who has health issues to consult your doctor about taking ACV and honey and bee pollen, but I assure you, unless you are allergic to something in the bee pollen, you WILL feel better. It will happen gradually and one day you will realize you feel better than you've felt in years and you are doing more than you have in years."</blockquote><p class="BackToTop"><div class="action-icons"><ul><li><a href="/contactus.php?action=Feedback&pid=1&id=67857&title= Vitamin and Mineral Content of ACV" target="_new" class="ico-reply">Reply</a></li><li><a href="javascript: void(0)" onclick="MM_openBrWindow('/signin.php?st=1&nd=67857','','scrollbars=1,width=400,height=350')" class="ico-watch">Watch</a></li><li><a href="javascript: void(0)" onClick="mailPost('88995', ' Vitamin and Mineral Content of ACV', 'Feedback');" class="ico-email">Email</a></li><li><a href="javascript: void(0)" onClick="printPost('88995', ' Vitamin and Mineral Content of ACV', 'Feedback');" class="ico-print">Print</a></li><li><a href="#top" class="ico-top">To Top</a></li></ul></div></p></div>        <div style="padding-left:30px; padding-right:30px; padding-top:4px; padding-bottom:4px; background-color:#ffffff;">

I'm am plagued with digestive issues for about a year now and my doctor told me that I may have functional dyspepsia and mild ibs. I also have acne issues. And just two months ago I started to have symptoms of acid reflux like the throat sensation and chest tightness after eating. I felt miserable and helpless so I searched the internet for remedies and came across the apple cider vinegar remedy for heartburn and reflux. I started drinking apple cider vinegar about 1 tablespoon mixed in a glass of water roughly 8-10 oz twice a day. It is about a week and a half since I started drinking the AVC and so far there are no improvements. I still have reflux symptoms after eating, acne flare ups and loose stools (which is maybe due to the detox effect of the apple cider vinegar). I'm just wondering how much time does it take for me to see improvements or am I taking the wrong dosage of apple cider vinegar? thank you guys a lot."</p></font><font color="navy">Replies</font><div style="width: 165px;"><div style="background-color: navy; border-top: 1px solid navy;"></div></div>

First of all, I am not a professional health provider, but I did want to relay my own experiences so far, using ACV, and hopefully add some suggestions. The first thing I would recommend is to see a doctor for all of your symptoms. That being said, here are my own experiences, which some are similar to your own. I have been diagnosed with acid reflux and have been taking the "purple pill" for years!! Like you, I searched the internet for more natural solutions to my many illnesses. I also have adult onset asthma, chronic sinusitis, hives, allergies, mild acne, and high blood pressure.... But I am also a lot older than you, so hopefully you won't have to go through what I did! Not to mention the tremendous money I have spent for all of these meds over the years... I could have bought a small country!! Anyway, in my search, I found several websites that basically said the same things about apple cider vinegar, which was that it has been used for centuries, starting with Hippocrates, an ancient Greek physician, who was considered to be the father of western medicine, who not only advocated ACV, but used it himself!</P><P>And so with all of the knowledge that I gained in my investigation of ACV, along with a LOT of testimonials, especially here at EC, I decided to try it! I am so glad I did! I have been taking ACV now for going on 7 weeks and it has "quieted" my system! I find I have so many benefits.... Some I hadn't expected! I no longer need "the purple pill" because I don't suffer from the symptoms of acid reflux; I am weening myself off of all my medication... Just to see if all I need is apple cider vinegar... But I still have my meds on stand by... Just in case! My mild acne has totally gone away; my blood pressure has stabilized; my sinus are just as clear without sinus meds... AND without the side effects! I also don't have upset stomach, and my appetite has subsided a LOT!!! Other side benefits is that I'm losing weight and I sleep a little more soundly at night! I don't know what kind of ACV you're using, but make sure that it unpasturized, raw and organic with "The Mother", which is the enzyme that settles at the bottom of the bottle, and part of the normal production process with natural apple cider vinegar. That's where all the "good stuff" is. Each time you use it, make sure to shake the bottle very well before using. For a while, there was a company that is pretty popular for making this type of apple cider vinegar (ACV), but now another familiar company that is known for making vinegar of all kinds, (found in grocery stores) has just introduced their own version with "The Mother", and it's just as good! I take about 3 tablespoons with 3 tablespoons of raw honey (the raw honey needs also be organic, and also has a lot of health benefits! ), mix that together well, then add 8-12 ounces of purified drinking water. I add ice, then sip through a straw, (otherwise, the ACV eats at your tooth enamel over time). I do this twice a day... Like clockwork. I am so pleased with my results, and I hope you will continue to take it! I hope it works as well for you as it has for me!! God Bless you in your quest!!"</blockquote>		<blockquote><div style="height:15px;"></div>

01/04/2011: Mike  from Montreal, Quebec, Canada replies: "Let me clarify the following for you: "ACID TO TREAT AN ACID CONDITION". To begin with, imagine a valve that separates your stomach acid from your esophagus. Now suppose I were to tell you that mother nature designed your body in a such a way THAT THE OPENING AND CLOSING OF THIS VALVE IS CONTROLLED BY THE PH LEVEL OF YOUR STOMACH. That is, when you are hungry and about to eat, your stomach secretes a lot of HCL acid in order to digest your food. This valve actually stays shut if the PH level of your stomach is very acidic thus preventing acid from damaging the upper portion of your body. If you do not secrete enough stomach acid (some people are born with this condition) then the acidity level in your stomach is not sufficient to keep this valve properly shut. The results is GERD. </P>
<P>SOLUTION: Take the stomach acid test to determine if you secrete enough HCL acid. If it is always to low then that is the cause of your GERD and you should consider taking HCL Betaine supplements. Believe me I use to have GERD although not as severe as you and when I consumed HCL betaine capsules, I immediately felt that suddenly there is no large amount of mucous being constantly secreted inside my throat. Also I notice that my tongue always stays red instead of always being coated with this white mucous stuff. That is how I know that ACID can treat an ACID condition. Hope that helps you!

That is what is causing my GERD. In the exam, the DRs giving me the exam, said that they had NEVER seen GERD react as fast as mine - the moment it hit my stomach, up went the acid. I did Prilosec, Zantac, etc. I was still having GERD while on those meds. I then did research on ACV. It's harsh but I don't have any issues with GERD when I take it.

Occasionally I could not even digest my food for days. I would have night sweats and general flu like feelings. I was prescribed pills from the doctor, and also tried the over the counter pills, all with varying results of success depending upon the severity of my condition. I had all the fun tests done on my digestive system with no real issues found, except Barrett's esophageal which the acid burning my throat caused. I determined to resolve the problem, and read many articles about diet. For me it was coffee, smoking, and stress which caused my worst break outs (in hindsight). Alcohol could also trigger an outbreak. Not overloading my body with coffee all day and drinking in the evening accompanied with smoking throughout, alone made a big difference. But while I was making these changes in diet I found information on how pills might not be that great for someone either, and I found Ted's recipe. Perhaps I should say I found the ACV treatment first, which didn't do anything for me, but then I added the Baking Soda, and what a difference! I threw the pills away and have never been back since! I began taking it 2-3 times a day, and after a week I was doing it only occasionally. Now I take it only as needed, maybe once or twice a month, though it wouldn't hurt if I did it more regularly. My most serious gerd symptoms are gone and now I only get occasional heartburn when that diet I spoke about earlier gets a little heavy on the bad stuff. But just one or two treatments in a day have me back on track. Make no mistake, for the worst conditions, you must modify your diet. I cut the coffee, stopped smoking (for awhile), and limit my alcohol consumption (though it's worse or as bad as coffee to me). After making difficult changes I was able to return to normal enjoyments in moderation. All things in moderation is something which must be observed for the best recovery. My mix is slightly different than Ted's by accident. I was confused about the water so I only used enough to slightly dilute the mixture, about 2-3 ounces of water (an easy amount to take in one or two gulps). A minute later I let out a big burp and I feel instant relief everywhere. If I do not feel better or burp I give it about 30 minutes and I do it again. I've never had to do it a third time, and once the symptoms are gone I don't do it again until they return. Usually I will be back in moderation mode and it isn't necessary until my next slip up. Also, I only use 1/4 to 1/3 teaspoon of baking soda to two teaspoons of ACV, so a lot of baking soda is not necessary, as has been mentioned. This is not a temporary daily fix like antacids, the effects seem to last days. Recently I was with friends for a weekend. It was early evening when we started drinking and my reflux began hammering me more than I had seen in a long time. I took this remedy and resumed to the festivities (hoping it would undo the damage that had already started and allow me to continue what I had started) and with only 1 dose I was fine all that weekend through the all "fun". I am posting this because my friends made alot of fun for me for this recipe. I explained that I did not know how it works, but I have tried alot of things and it just works. And works it does! Apparently, it can even stop reflux dead in its tracks when moderation isn't optional! My friends aren't convinced (likely far from it), but if you suffer, try this, it works, and it cost maybe 5 bucks for a 6 month supply. It has been about 2 years since I first read and begun this cure, thank you Ted! I try to pass it along to those who will listen."</p></font><font color="navy">Replies</font><div style="width: 165px;"><div style="background-color: navy; border-top: 1px solid navy;"></div></div>

Bitter greens will increase bile production but will strengthen digestion as well as alkalize you. As far as the lower digestive tract and liver pain have you tried colonics and flax/ psyllium/ charcoal stuff, early and late in the day, to promote more regularity?

Sit as upright as you can for 5 hours after eating ANYTHING. You'll notice you wake up in the morning with 0 buring throat. Also NO SPICES--especially before bed. Even if you sit up right, spices BURN your throat in acid reflux, they'll make your stomach feel raw, bad, and sick--not HUGELY noticeable, but still, kick the spices! I use Morton's Kosher Salt--flavors my food BEAUTIFULLY. Also ramen noodle chicken flavored packets added to water fake chicken stock well! Be sure you ONLY by the ramen noodles with NO transfat and NO MSG's!!!! They exist at grocery stores, you have to check the packaging though!!!!

I've read that when you ingest an alkalizing substance the process of the acid being neutralized will give you a nauseous feeling. Like drinking a huge 32oz of water first thing in the morning.
