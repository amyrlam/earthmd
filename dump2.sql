5280	91	6250	Painfree from Oregon	2006-11-11 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Alright, I must post again. I am posting because I want all to know who reads that the ACV works, and I am still painfree. It is 6:01 pm here in Oregon. I am "With The Mother" _______ raw and unfiltered organic apple cider vinegar. The price was $2.79. This vinegar contains no preservatives. It tastes great. This morning when I woke up, I was so awake. This is a miracle. Usually when I wake up, I dread it, I still have pain; it takes all night long to try to concentrate on getting the reflux pain to back off. This morning I was filled with so much energy. I cleansed my face before I went to bed last night. I put about 3 drops of ACV in my hand, added 6 drops of water, rubbed my hands together and patted it on my facial skin, being careful not to get it in my eyes. I let it air dry, and then over the top, I placed my moisturizing creme. I told my husband, I do not care if I smell like the apple orchard, if I have to bath in ACV I will, for I went to bed with no pain, and woke up with no pain. I slept like a newborn baby. I did not wake up to get water or use the bathroom. My face felt like soft silk, and it still does right now. _______ ACV and olive oil went on my sandwich with feta cheese and one slice of tomato, lettuce and maple cured ham on healthy nut bread. I am drinking lots of water too. This is the first time since the last past 5 years that I have enjoyed eating a meal. I also had a small glass of apple juice. I had so much energy in the wind and rain and walking down the mall lanes to get to the health food store. My ACV is my new friend and she will go wherever I go. I have no cough, no neck pain, no back or leg pain. I have not had to take medicine for the cough. I feel so clean on the inside of me. My acid reflux and cough medicine look so lonely sitting next to My 16 fl. Oz. _______ ACV. I was so in pain yesterday, I could not stand it one more minute trying to concentrate on trying to get the pain to stop. I was so worn out. My skin had become so dry from the medication, I was tired all day long from the medication and lack of sleep. I did go grocery shopping, I read to find out which foods were the healthiest, and my grocery bill came out 40 dollars cheaper. I bought fresh foods, foods that contain low fat, low sugar, no more than 17 g.: Here is a partial list: peaches, live and active culture yogurt, lots of green veggies, fresh water fish, Cornish hens, the feta cheese, apple cider, hazelnut bread, yams, celery, melons, light olive oil and royal jelly, pure organic honey. I must say the kind I chose was made from bees from out of the United States. The reason being is because of my developed allergies, so my heart said to do that, just because of the blossoms here I live around. I will be learning about more foods that are better for my health, and now that my stomach and chest and neck does not ache, I will be healthy inside and out. My mouth tastes good, no foul body smells, which the medications were doing to me, plus throwing my body chemistry so out of whack. When you are so used to being half asleep from allergy meds, and stomach meds, you just go with it. But when you feel awake and so full of energy, then you find out, you realize, you have been asleep in your life. I have faith that this ACV is the key to the cure. I do want to tell a quick story here about vinegar in my lifetime. When I was a little girl, we used it to pull out the curds from our soap in our hair when we washed it. Also, the vinegar was a great balance and put a lot of shine in your hair, kept it at the right Ph. I craved vinegar when I was little, and when my mother was not looking I would drink one or two capfuls of it in the bathtub. When she found out I was drinking it, she told me to stop because I would get ulcers. She hid the bottle lol. Oh, I found it, and took little sips now and then. Yes, I was worried I would get ulcers, but I craved it so much. I was raised up on a farm, and I got sick on dairy foods, which I did not know at that time I had a problem with milk. The only times I was not sick was when I was able to take sips of that vinegar. I look back at my life from then and now, and I can see what the vinegar was doing to me, and it was not about to give me an ulcer, it was keeping my body in balance. The other quick story about vinegar is, that it was a house hold remedy for bruises. As soon as you hit or knocked your arms or legs or head, you quickly put vinegar on that area, and you never, ever got a bruise. I did the same thing for my children as they grew up, immediately put the vinegar my children's legs and arms, when they fell down, or knocked their heads, and they never showed bruises either. I did not think much about it; it was just something I learned from my mother; Rest in peace, I love you mom, and I have my vinegar. And also, we did not have a lot of other medicines, so we used products from the pantry. It did not hurt like rubbing alcohol, or that red staining stuff. So those are my stories. I was taking the type of pain killer that contained no ibuprofen, but they did not work after a while, so I decided to go with the ibuprofen anyway, seemed I had no choice, either that or pain anyway. It was a catch 22 all the way around. Yes, I am "With The Mother" unfiltered organic apple cider vinegar, and I will stick with her. My quick prayer is this: goodbye drugs, scares about esophageal cancer or someone cutting out my body parts. Cheers to you Earth Clinic, you have saved my body, and you will save many others too. I am letting others know about this information too, for I want no one else to be acid reflux pain either. Hugs, and take that ACV with plenty of water, follow the directions. You will feel clean inside and out, with no pain, and have skin soft as a baby in no time at all.

Been on all kinds of meds Nexium, prilosec, you name it they work for a while, then they are not very effective. Tried apple cider vinegar two table spoons three times a day and it works for me!! Henry. I don't know if it cured it but it works!
5323	91	6291	Laurie from Enfield, CT	2006-04-18 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	After 5 trips to the Emergency Room (with heart attack symptoms) and a weekend stay in the hospital (where they ruled everything out, but diagnosed nothing!), I was getting sick and tired of being sick and tired! I was pretty sure I hadn't become asthmatic and I indeed was at low-risk for heart disease, but you never know! An endless parade of physicians (with hands held out).. cardiologist, pulmonologist, gastroentologist, family doctors, and Physician Assistants with their prescriptions of Toporol-XL, aspirin, Albuterol, Advair, Prevacid, Zantac, Nexium, Prilosec, Zegerid (the mother of them all), Tums, Maalox, Gavascon! You name it, they had me on it... normally all at the same time. I knew this pain and suffering wasn't just in my head (which was what they begin to hint), although my stress level and feelings of anxiety were peaking. I seem to hit pay dirt finally with the Gastro specialist, and he ordered up some test and then took off on vacation for almost two weeks. So there I was sitting-overmedicated, vomiting, dizzy, unable to eat, drink(even water), sleep, breathe normally, walk any distance, or lift anything. Rapidly, I was becoming a nonfunctioning participate in the lives of my husband and kids. In the middle of the night, during one nasty episode, I dragged myself crying to the computer and sat down and typed in all my symptoms and info. The search engine brought up some similar case scenario and directed me to this site (earthclinic.com) where people were praising the "_______'s ACV with the Mother," and the almost unbelievable results they received from using it. Until the break of dawn, I read story after story... always harboring that well known saying "If it sounds too good to be true, it probably isn't.", but at this point, I had nothing to lose (except my sanity!) That morning, I made the decision. I found some in the organic section of my local Shaw's Supermarket and raced home. I mixed 1 teaspoon in about 4 ounces of water and drank it down. Literally, in 15-20 minutes, I felt like doing cartwheels! How could this be! Over the next 24 hours, I stopped ALL medications and started using'it 3 times a day. I have not had another symptom since! In fact, for the first time in almost 10 years (since the birth of my first), I slept through the entire night (9 hours straight vs. waking every 2). I am elated! Of course, I will keep my appointment and have my endoscopy/ colonoscopy next week, when my doctor returns. Never once, did any doctor hint of a natural cure or relief from my symptoms. I can't wait to question him.

5480	92	6448	Cheryl from San Francisco, Ca	2012-09-26 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I, like so many other women who have posted their comments on this site have suffered with Yeast Infections and BV my entire life. HOWEVER, I do have to say that certain sexual partners trigger it in me and others do not. I also work out daily and no matter what loose fitting workout clothes I wear or the fact that I shower immediately after working out, anytime I get wet from swimming, humidity, intense heat, working out, etc. , it triggers problems for me. So in the past, I was constantly at my OB/GYN doctor for all kinds of medications and spending far too much $$, only to gain temporarily relief. I was so frustrated and pretty much gave up on ever having a normal life and sex life UNTIL I found a website started by a mid-wife with homeopathic remodies. That is when I first learned of hydrogen peroxide mixed with distilled/purified water as a douche. I will admit, I was scared to try it, but desperate enough to do so. I did and guess what... For the first time in my life, I was yeast and BV infection free! I travel alot for my job and the first thing I do when I land is stop at a drug store and purchase hydrogen peroxide and a douche named YEAST GUARD ADVANCED. The douche itself already contains acidophilus/pro-biotics and peroxide, but I use a little and then add more H2O2 and sometimes empty 1-2 capsules of high potency acidophilus powder into the mixture and shake it all up. The douche bottles are convenient and disposable or re-usable (I rinse them after use with H2O2 to sanitize them). Talk about relief at the first signs of any symptoms! My bathroom is always stocked with both. In addition, I take pro-biotics orally as well as drink Raw Apple Cider Vinegar (Mother formula) everyday (1-2 TBLS with an 8oz glass of water) and follow a candida diet for the most part (sometimes I give in to cravings and cheat). My advice is give it a try! You have nothing to lose except for you BV and yeast infections.

There is certainly not any truth to this, or I would not have them.
5624	94	6592	Richard from Boulder, CO	2008-06-16 00:00:00	BETTER BUT NOT CURED	2	0	I'm 28 and have been experiencing progressively worse pain for about a month on the right side of my lower back through to the right ball/testicle/baby-maker, and even down the right but-cheek and inside of my right thigh. Keep in mind that I'm 28 years old and in very good shape, exercising 24/7. So you can see my concern. At first I thought I might have testicular cancer on the right ball, but everything feels fine, and I "sense" the pain originating from the right kidney area. The thigh is probably due to toxic or limited blood flow from/to that kidney. Thank heavens our bodies keep the toxins from our hearts and lungs until last, I guess. I took creatine recently at the suggestion of a physical trainer, and I bet that is the source of the problem, since I can trace my pain to the time I started taking Betagen, first, and then some other creatine loader, pretty much every day. I got really sick, flu-like symptoms, and am just now getting over it. After reading all the other posts, I realized that every piss I was taking while on these supplements was cloudier and cloudier, so that's really why I'm pointing the finger for now. After doing some quick research and finding this website and discussion, earlier this afternoon, I'm convinced I've got a stone and am trying the lemon juice and olive oil remedy as we speak. Here's the breakdown: - Found out about miracle cure @ 2:30 pm, at work. Immediately drank 6 glasses of water. - Went home on bike, (uncomfortable of course) and shopped for ingredients that I'd read about: lemon juice, olive oil, and magnesium, which I'll add to the routine if the little SOB doesn't come out. - Took first dose at 4:00 pm, roughly. Dose was 3x3 oz lemon juice to olive oil. Drank like 4 glasses of water. Went down no problem. - At 6:00 pm I drank a bigger dose, 5x5 oz lemon juice to olive oil, but cheated and lathered it up with toasted bread (like the other guy). Go big or go home. Followed with 3 glasses of water. - It is 6:50 pm Mountain Time and I've got a full chicken in the oven, stuffed with couscous, garlic, and onion, and it's totally lathered in olive oil, which I'll down with a glass of lemon and water, so that everything is basically proportional, 1:1. So, I'm in mid-recycling state I guess. I'll update tomorrow. I can say that I had a little weird sensation feeling in the kidney about 1/2 hour ago. Hurt and then tickled. Who knows, only time will tell. Cyndi from NC: Thanks for the suggestion. I think my odds are pretty good, judging by the ratio of success stories to failures/surgeries. Probably around 70%, as long as my innards don't get so lubed up with excess olive oil that they slip outta me. :)

5669	94	6637	Donnie from Louisville, KY	2007-11-23 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	re: Xtra Virgin Olive Oil and Lemon Juice:This worked for my large, stuck stone. This is a Yea for me.  And delightfully so.  I was in the hospital four times in 2004 and had three procedures; two lithotripsies and one Laser device with the basket retrieval method.  As you can imagine, I have been terrified of a recurrence of that BS!!!  So, I made sure to make a good multivitamin and drink very few sodas. Early this past summer I had some pain that was very bothersome but not something I had to go to the hospital.  Not to play down the pain, but in 2004 I would get to the point where I would vomit and dry heave to no end and would end up in the ER.  Yes, the drug Delotid is frigging awesome baby!!!  Man, that stuff sorta saved my life.  Took all pain away.  So, I have been trying to avoid that stuff again. Anyway, I have had symptoms off and on, but I didn't see a doctor about them.  You either need surgery or you don't, you know??  I never found the pain meds to be very useful for kidney stones.  I mean all the way to oxycotin:  not applicable to this kind of pain.  Well, it got bad enough that I HAD to see someone.  So I did.  CT showed two stones: one in the upper right quadrant of the right kidney, and one stuck in the right ureter above the bladder.  Since I had had symptoms for months, the urologist figured that this stuck stone had been causing all my problems.  The one in the kidney was 5mm, and I never heard what size the one was in the ureter.  I figure it was pretty big.  They wanted me to have a doctor use a cytoscope to snatch it out.  I found this out right before going to Los Angeles for a seminar.  I began taking Flomax, and spent the night in LA not sleeping and vomiting again, so I said no more Flomax.  Get home and find this website, and figure anything is preferable to what I knew I would be facing.  So, Wednesday evening I took one dose of stuff:  2 ounces Olive Oil, and two ounces of fresh lemon juice.  And wait. Went to the movies Thanksgiving night.  Went to the bathroom prior to the movie and it felt "weird".  Really weird.  I had to go after the movie, and I felt something happening, a very odd sensation, and out comes a frigging humongous stone.  Good gawd!!!  It was bigger around than a pea, and sort of longer too.  BUT, although it felt odd, it really did not hurt.  It went into the urinal and I couldn't snatch it out.  If it was a toiled bowl, public or not, I would have reached in and got it.  Sort of like a trophy, eh?  I feel deprived. Now I will use the lemon juice to try to dissolve the one in the kidney, and pray.  Monday I will call the doctor's office and see how big that stone was.  And my stones are always the calcium ones, the most common kind.  I figure I will get the magnesium and zinc supplement and see about the baking soda too.  Thanks for the information guys.

6235	102	7187	Amy from Denver, CO	2009-06-01 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I'd been suffering for a week from a sinus infection and was not interested in my doctor's advised treatment of 10 days on harsh antibiotics (which incidentally had never cured a sinus infection for me in the 3 times in the past that they'd prescribed it.) So, I google'd "holistic sinus infection cure" and found this site. After reading a few dozen posts on the "sinus infection" page, I found a couple of things to try; here are my results: 1. ACV: while I'd read that this works best at the first signs of a cold and I was already five days in, I tried it anyway. About 1-2 Tbs in hot water with a dash of lemon juice and some agave syrup to sweeten it and I drank it like a tea. Very pleasant with the agave and I started to feel some relief soon after drinking (I also inhaled the steam after mixing and felt some relief from that too.) Since it didn't provide as much instant relief as I was hoping for, and WAS providing some canker sores in my mouth, I limited this to just the first day or two and then stopped. 2. Oil Pulling: I started this at the same time as the other remedies so I'm not certain what the effect has been on curing my sinus infection, but I can attest that I feel better, my skin looks amazing, my breath has significantly improved and I no longer see a white film on the surface of my tongue. This is after just 3-4 days of use. I'm using 1 Tbs of organic sesame oil, swished around for 15-20 minutes every morning right upon waking, then spit out, of course. 3. Grapefruit Seed Extract: I think this was the magic bullet for me. I've been using 2-5 drops (teeny, tiny drops) in with my saline sinus irrigation twice a day for the last 4 days and I am almost 100% better. This (and the oil pulling) I've been doing consistently. While I didn't feel immediate relief after my first irrigation with the GSE, every time since then I feel the pressure release from behind my face and my cheekbones stop aching. Now my symptoms are almost completely gone; I cannot believe it. On the first couple of days I was using more drops (4-5) and now I'm down to 2 drops. It doesn't taste the best when it runs down your throat and there is a funny sensation that it creates that is kind of like burning but not painful, but all in all it's really easy; not much different than just plain saline. I have to say I'm totally blown away at how much better I feel and without aid of antibiotics. I did continue to take ibuprofin in limited amounts (no more than once a day) when the pain was more than I could take), but other than that I've been cured by these holistic remedies. I'm so grateful for this website and all of the people who have posted their success stories on here! I never would have known to try these things had it not been for finding this resource. Thank you!!
6314	106	7213	Eric  from Spring, Texas	2009-01-01 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	My son (7yrs old) had a really bad sinus infection that was causing a fever really bad snoring and over all discomfort. Had this 2 days. Over the counter meds would not work. He has had this before in the past and the doctor would prescribe anti bionics. Doctors have there place, but I'm sick and tired of the meds they push. We decided to take the natural route this time around. I searched the net, found this site. Ill keep this short, but I performed a sinus rinse on my son. I took a "Netti Pot" with a little over 8oz of warm distilled water. added 1 packet of the sodium stuff and 1 tbl spoon of Apple Cider Vinegar. His fever broke the same night and it appeared to knock his infection out. He sleeps much better now. I also have my son drink ACV...1 TBS with warm water and honey like a tea. Keep in mind, anytime you do a sinus rinse, use distilled water. If your child has sinus, allergy or asthma issues, I highly recommend a sinus rinse at least 3 days a week even if they are fine. Never use more that 1 tbl on a child for a rinse. Stings! I always test on myself before application for temp of water and sting factor of ACV. Add more water if you feel the sting is a bit much for your child. After doing this, we were able to get globs of bacteria ridden snot out of my child's nose. I know most of you will have hell doing a rinse on a child. My son is an avid swimmer. He also accompanies me when I spearfish in the salt waters of Baja Mexico. He's use to salt water, in and out of his nose. But I encourage you to keep trying. It does work. It is truly amazing to see something so common and available work so quickly. I was so impressed with the results, I had to post hoping this remedy can help others. If you have never used a Netti Pot. please follow the instructions thoroughly. Try it on yourself first to get the technique own. Most pots can be brought at a local convience store with a pharmacy section.Pots come with packets of sodium that I used. I also added the ACV for more potency. Based on my observation, the ACV was the key factor in the rinse. The sodium alone didn't have as dramatic an effect.

5091	91	6061	Toni from Palm Desert, CA	2007-02-27 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have bouts of acid reflux, and am therefore intrigued by the Apple Cider Vinegar remedy. Like a number of the people who responded to your posting, I, too, ended up in the emergency room on more than one occasion surrounded by perplexed physicians. Since I won't take pharmaceuticals, I began experimenting with natural remedies, and have found that taking an ounce of Whole Leaf Aloe Vera Concentrate before each meal stops any unpleasant symptoms. Interestingly, aloe tastes a little like ACV. In addition to the aloe, I have found that chewing each mouth-full of (wholesome) food thoroughly before swallowing helps enormously. This takes much of the digestive burden off of the stomach. It's important to eat your meal slowly, chewing each bite of food until it's totally pulverized. Too many of us eat under stressful conditions, devouring our meal like it's the first we've seen in days. DGL-500 (deglycyrrhizinated licorice), Ayurved series, is also quite helpful when taken between meals or at bedtime. It helps to protect the stomach lining, and unlike regular licorice, will not elevate blood-pressure.
5092	91	6062	Susan from Bayfield, CO	2006-04-09 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I found that drinking a half cup of aloe vera juice mixed with apple or white grape juice in the morning relieved symptoms dramatically. I occasionally get symptoms if I over indulge spices or greasy foods!
5093	91	6063	Bill from Baguio City, Philippines	2008-11-23 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I spent most of my 70 years suffering with an acid stomach. Tried everything. I couldn't even drink a glass of water without my stomach burning. One day I read an article in Reader's Digest about an Australian Doctor who discovered the Helicobacter Pylori Bacteria in the stomach. After reading his story I went to my doctor. They did an Endoscopy on my stomach and the biopsy proved I had the H. Pylori Bacteria. Took antibiotics for two weeks and since that time I have had NO stomach burning sensation except for when I eat flaming chili!! They now have a test for this bacteria using your breath in a balloon an analyzing the breath. My stomach is GREAT and I'm so glad I read that article!! I hope your stomachs get cured so you can truly enjoy life.
5094	91	6064	Joe from Helena, Mt	2008-04-09 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	One year ago, I had a dentist appointment-Infected tooth. I was prescribed an antibiotic. About a year previously, on the news, was a story about a researcher discovering that some bacteria in your stomach could not be killed by antiboitics alone. Antibiotics and the metal barium combined could kill those bacterica.That story, for some"strange reason", did not become part of the medical lore surrounding the agony of common people involved in the extremely expensive fight with ACID REFLUX. One year later, ten days of antibiotics, one and one half ounce of Pepto Bismol each of seven of those days--I am free of agonizing sleepless hours. I'm 67 Years old- probably 10 of which I have suffered with acid reflux. Try it. It cost Me about 15 bucks. It could cost those who profit from "acid reflux" billions - Think for yourself! Good Luck.

Disaster struck, I couldn't breath, the strong fumes from undiluted ACV force the epiglottis to close and I could not breath, I thought I was going to die right there, but finally recovered.

I dont feel the burning in my stomach and have stopped taking proliscec.

I purchased the Apple Cider Vinegar and used the suggested dosage, 2 tablespoons with 1/4 teaspoon of Bicarb Of Soda in a glass of warm water. This was taken 1hr before a meal 3 times a day. After 3 days the acid reflux has become more pronounced both day and night.

I have a tblspn of ACV (with the mother!! ) with 12oz of purified spring water and a touch of pure flavoring in the AM with my fibery breakfast. Now it's more like 3 pepcid completes in one week if I have lots of spicy food. I'm going to have to give ACV (with the mother) two thumbs up. Been on it 2 months or so.

5108	91	6078	Thomas  from Celje, Slovenia	2011-01-30 00:00:00	WORKED TEMPORARILY	3	0	Hi. First sorry for my English. :) I first started to get the acid reflux symptoms, that all of you described, 4 month ago. I had really bad panic attack not knowing what is wrong. Went to heart and lung specialist, done ultrasound, everything. No problems there. Doctor suggested that may be acid reflux. I don't smoke, I don't drink alcohol, my only sin is lots of Chocolate. I got some pills that didn't help at all. Come across this really good site, so I started ACV 1 month ago, plus putting myself on a diet. Since than, I lost 5 kg, but the symptoms are still there. Maybe for 10 days I went without any symptoms, but suddenly this week they are back. So I started with ACV again. Averell the condition is much better than 4 month ago, sadly not good enough. Only difference is, that I have no problems at night. I sleep OK, raised my bad like suggested. One thing I dont understande is, why withine 5 minutes I wake up, I started to feel my throat again ? I have some more question, if somebody can answer them, I would appreciated: Can I eat probiotic yogurt once a day? Can apples and bananas trigger acid reflux? (I have had some bad reaction mixing those two fruits) Can I drink 1 cup of 0.5% skim milk for breakfast and dinner ? Can I take ACV before breakfast-lunch and before dinner Aloe Vera? Can I mix those two treatments ? Last quaestion. I am serious recreational cycliste. I do around 13.000 km per year, so I use to drink a lot of special sports drink and proteins. Now I don't even want to think about drinking that stuff. Can someone suggest what to drink on a 3-5 training ? Just water won't cut it. Can I put into the water 1 tablespoon of diet fructose sugar? Also, I am afraid to use those energy bars and similar product, which are essential for that kind of physical stress. When I started riding this year, I am feeling almost 100% on the bike, Acid reflux wise. But with no energy, probably because of the diet. Thanks for any advice, Regards Thomas.

" til I was ready to hurt him! Ok you get the point. He refused to eat in the evenings, and even though thats probably a good idea, it was limiting. I mixed my cocktail of 1 tbs organic ACV in blueberry/pomegranate juice just to see if it made him feel as good as it does I. I never thought it would help with any ailment specifically and certainly not right away. He had NO reflux from the very first use. Now even when he eats, he has no more acid reflux. I do indeed love this stuff. It works. And I highly recommend the cocktail above(through a straw of course) as it complimets the ACV very well. Like a juice with a zing.

My question is for reflux and gatroparesis what do you recommend? It maybe genetic or due to the fact that I had major chemo and internal radiation ten years ago but ever since I had my stem cell transplant I have had chronic acid in my throat. I have even had a gastric bollis (sp?). When I take ACV it burns my stomach for at least an hour. I an taking prevasid so I realize I may not have enough acid but wanted to get your feedback on what I should do thanks so much!

5113	91	6083	Susan from Ontario, Canada	2010-07-02 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Apple Cider Vinegar cured my acid reflux. I had suffered from severe acid reflux for many years, and stumbled on your site while trying to find an alternative to ranitidine and PPSIs. My acid reflux was so severe that the pain was similar to having a heart attack, and I could not sleep unless I was sitting up. I started using apple cider vinegar (1 tbsp in one glass of water) 20 minutes before my evening meal,and within two weeks, had no more symptoms. I have now been taking ACV for about a year, and have had NO recurrences of acid reflux whatsoever, and no side effects - unless you count a 10 lb weight loss as a side affect! Thank you to Earth Clinic for offering an alternative to pharmaceuticals! And BTW,the ACV has also cured my toenail fungus. This stuff is absolutely amazing!!
5114	91	6084	Erin  from Glen Ellyn, Il, 60137	2010-06-28 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I am 34 years old and have had acid reflux for a couple of years, and possibly longer. I ignored the symptoms until 3 months ago when I experienced throat tightening. I am a teacher, and suddenly I would get extremely congested and my vocal cords would cramp up every day after breakfast and lunch. I would try to drink glass after glass of water just to make it through the day, but at one point I wasn't able to finish reading a story to my students. At the same time, the symptoms started piling on: heartburn, coughing, sneezing, and acid in the back of my throat after eating. I would also wake up with a sore throat every morning. Since then, I've gotten an upper endoscopy and stopped caffeine, alcohol, chewing mint gum, and limited dairy products. Also, I don't eat 2 to 3 hours before bedtime and sleep on a bed that is elevated 7 inches. Due to this, all of my symptoms stopped except for the throat tightening. At that point, I was desperate, because I didn't know how I was going to be able to teach. I tried two medications, one of which I'm on currently, but neither has helped. So three weeks ago, at the beginning of my summer school session, I discovered this website and I started drinking ACV. What a relief! When I drink it, my throat and vocal cords immediately relax. For three weeks straight, I have sipped ACV water throughout the day and I have been able to teach and read books out loud. I mix 1 tablespoon ACV with 20 ounces of water and sip it through a straw so as not to have it touch my teeth. I drink this three times a day after every meal. Every day I try to make it without drinking the ACV to see if the medication is going to kick in, but my vocal cord cramping becomes so extreme that I quickly start drinking the ACV just to be able to talk to my students. I'm thinking of going off the medicine since I only needed it for this one symptom and it's not even helping. Thanks to this website, my tears of frustration have stopped. I will keep drinking ACV for as long as I need to because it works! It saved my summer session and probably my next year of teaching as well!
5122	91	6092	Ernie from St Petersburg, Florida	2010-02-28 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I'm a 69 year old male in good physical condition. I was diagnosed recently with Acid Reflux. My doctor prescribed Prevacid. I asked him how long I would have to take it. He said "the rest of my life". That's when I went to the internet and found this web-site. I started taking the ACV recipe (2) 1/2 teaspoons in 8 oz's of water either before or with meals. I've been on this for about 6 weeks now and I can say, it has worked for me! I have not had any heart burn at all! The only thing I'm wondering about is, is it just "masking the heartburn" as does Tums, etc. Because if that is the case you can still get cancer of the esophagus! Not good! I have grown to actually like the taste of the ACV.
5115	91	6085	Lynda from San Diego, Ca	2010-06-22 00:00:00	BETTER BUT NOT CURED	2	0	I have had acid reflux for over four years. My valve isn't working properly. The doctor recommended the purple pill and a bland diet. I tried the pill but it is almost as bad as the reflux, so I stopped. For the last four years I have chewed gum and if necessary used an over the counter liquid. It has worked okay until I ate too much one night and burnt my esophagus. Bad move. The doctor placed me on another type of pill. I took it for 14 days (he recommended twice the dose for thirty days, I only took one for 14) not feeling a lot better. I saw your site and decided, the day I finished my first suggested doses of medicine, to start ACV. I used one tablespoon in 16ozs of drinking water, morning and evening. Immediately helped. I eat an apple before my lunch, and a lot more water than normal. I have been doing much better, especially for sleeping at night. I am going to try the bicarbonate soda too to see if it works better. I'm still waiting to see a specialist just to ask some questions and get his opinion. I have totally changed my diet but it needs some tweeking. When I'm stressed I have a little more of a problem. The apples help that. I have noticed more benifits to this situation. My sinisus have cleared up, my teeth are whiter and I have lost five pounds. I wish I had known this a lot sooner. Not perfect but I am grateful for the help. Thank you, Lynda

I stopped the medication and tried the ACV and baking soda for 2 days. On day 3, I feel 100% better than I did before. I also stopped drinking coffee as well. It is hard, but tea will have to do until I get this acid reflux under control. Thanks to everyone who posted their experiences on this site. It was very helpful. I will post again to update my progress.
5117	91	6087	Cajun from Opelousas, La	2010-05-17 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	For most of my young adolescent life, I lived virtually every day of my life with acid reflux; baking soda when convenient, antacid tablets during other times. Once computers came into the Engineering profession, I daily combined about 3-4 oz of ACV with ice and water as my [32oz] drink. I've been without acid reflux for so long now (~35 years) that I have forgotten how long it took to relieve/cure my acid reflux. I'll be 70yo in 4 months and I never have any relapses....YES, ACV does 'cure' acid reflux.
5118	91	6088	Hugh from Greater London, Uk	2010-04-23 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I am a definite yea for ACV for reflux. When I have reflux, or a touch of biliousness from a meal (stomach locks off the food from the small intestine), I take 1 tablespoon of ACV (organic) with some lime juice and a dash of water- down in one (rinsing with water immediately after, a squash will do) and within 5 minutes the problem starts to resolve itself, if not resolved. Much quicker than zantac and natural. I swear by it, as do some others I know, for the same type of problem. My daughter, an anaesthetist is puzzled, acid on acid was her comment, BUT HEY for me it works.
5119	91	6089	D from Pittsburgh, Pa, Usa	2010-03-15 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I took the purple pill for years and years until it stopped working. I went to the doc for coughing fits, and hoarseness not realizing it was connected to acid reflux. He doubled my prescription of the purple pill to 2 a day, nothing got better in fact I got worse. I started searching for natural remedy, found this website and tried the apple cider vinegar plus honey and water. It started working immediately to fix the acid reflux. I went off the purple pill immediately and stayed on the ACV plus honey. It took 2-3 months but my hoarseness went away and eventually the cough. While taking the p pill, I had all the tests- barium xrays, endoscope, cat scans for the stomach and hoarseness and the ACV plus honey is what helped me. Now after 5 months, I am fine but I also changed my diet for a couple of months(stopped tomatoes, onions, coffee, menthol, mint)and stopped eating 3-4 hours before bed. I elevated the head of my bed 3-4 inches too. Now I only have problems if I over eat and go to bed too many days in a row. I am eating tomatoes, and onions again with no problem. I still don't eat menthol or mint or cafeine, to protect my esauphagous. The doctor told me it may take months or years to heal if ever. The purple pill does something to cause motility problems I guess, you can read side effects on the p pills websites. I spread the word about your website and the apple cider vinegar with MOTHER (buy in health stores or online) and honey to everyone I meet. You saved me. Thank you so much!!!!!
5120	91	6090	Angie from Minot, North Dakota, Usa	2010-03-05 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have been having a problem with reflux for several years now. I had been on prescription meds, but after seeing side effects others had listed online, I never stayed on them very long. I was also having severe anxiety problems where I felt like I couldn't breathe, felt nauseated, hot and all at very random times. I had tried ACV once before with terrible results. Earlier this week, I had the worst reflux burning I'd ever had and was about to succumb to the "purple pill" once again. I got on this site and read all the testimonials on ACV and decided that with how bad I was feeling, I might as well give it a try once again. I didn't have the organic kind with "the mother", so I just tried the regular. In about an hour, I realized that I didn't have ANY burning, pain or the sensation of anything coming back up. I slept like a baby and without keeping a cough drop in my cheek for the first time in...waaaay too long...years, probably. I have been using it for three days now and I cannot believe what a difference it has made! I didn't realize how disruptive my reflux was! I have not had any of those old anxiety feelings whatsoever since ACV! I believe it was all connected to the reflux. I have been more relaxed and don't have to feel panicky when I am out, having that nauseated, can't-breathe feeling. I have been enjoying life more and time with my little boy doesn't feel rushed, with me trying to "keep it all together". What a miracle! I will continue the ACV and spread the word! Thanks to this site and to all who have put their testimonials on here...I never would have tried it if it weren't for you!
5121	91	6091	Echo from Chicago, Il, Usa	2010-03-04 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I'm not usually someone that writes my experiences on websites however, this is an exception. My Dr. diagnosed me with Acid Reflux back in Jun/09 and hence gave me a prescription which I was told to take for 2 weeks. I literally felt worse. I was then given a different prescription and had absolutely no positive results. By chance I came upon this website and my world has changed. I started drinking 2 tablespoons of Apple Cider Vinegar with 8 ozs of water after every meal and a glass before bedtime and within the very 1st day I felt some relief. I continued for 3 weeks and I now feel "human" again. If I eat something like pizza I still may make a glass to drink. For the most part my symptoms are so manageable and I feel the best since I was diagonosed.. I just want to say thanks to the people that created this website. I also want to say shame on the Doctors for not letting acid reflux sufferers in on such a huge secret.

5126	91	6096	Tom  from Atlanta, Ga, USA	2010-01-05 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have suffered with acid reflux since 1985. I remember my mother telling me, "...just take some vinegar in the morning." I ignored her suggestion and started going to doctors. Nothing worked. I changed my diet and took everything the doctors prescribed. It got so bad that I would wake up in a start because I began vomiting while sleeping. I came across this website about 3 days ago and saw that people were recommending ACV and it reminded me of the home remedy my Mom had recommended years ago. I immediately went downstairs and took a teaspoon of ACV and followed it with a cup of water. Nasty stuff... but I noticed I didn't have any problems that night. I repeated the dosage yesterday morning and last night, I slept for 10 hours without interruption. I haven't slept more than 4 hours at a stretch for more than 20 years. I know its a little early to tell if the ACV is really doing the trick but so far I am a believer.

5129	91	6099	Bud from Benton, Arkansas	2009-12-01 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Apple cider vinegar and honey has definitely helped my acid reflux problem. I took a 2 liter(2 qt) plastic bottle, which is 8- 8oz servings and added 8oz ACV and 4oz of honey and filled with H2O. I started 6 days ago and drink 2 8oz glasses a day, one before breakfast and one before dinner. It has worked wonders! No more coughing and regurgating at night and the lump in my throat is about gone. On day 4, I decided to skip the one before dinner, just to see if it made a difference and I was coughing and food was coming up in the night. I went to the kitchen and drank a glass and slept the rest of the night without a problem. Before I started this, I would spray my throat several times a night to try and keep from coughing. I haven't sprayed my throat one time since I started doing this. I would recommend trying it to anyone. It may not work for everyone, but, so far it has worked great for me with no side effects!

The last year has been a nightmare with the acid reflux waking me in the middle of the night and feeling like I was choking to death. Sleeping on 5-6 pillows didn't help, nor did the many over the counter and prescription medicines. One night about 6 weeks ago, I googled "acid reflux" and read about the many believers in ACV. I take 1-2 TBS of organic AVC with about 1/2-3/4 cup organic apple juice every evening 30 minutes before bedtime. It works for me and I'm finally not afraid of going to sleep on 1 pillow.
5135	91	6105	Nick from New York City, NY	2009-07-10 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I am a 29 year old healthy adult who has been suffering from acid reflux for as long as I can remember. I have a healthy and active lifestyle and my diet is realtively good (no read meat and only moderate chicken). I have been taking Aciphex for about a year now and have been symptom free. However, I am fully aware of the negative side effects PPIs have on the body and was direly searching for an alternative, preferably a natural one. The other day I came across this website and decided to give apple cider vinegar a try. I didn't have too much hope as I have tried many natural home remedies in the past...all without much success. I started with 2 teaspoons of ACV in 8 oz of water with a spoonful of organic honey twice a day (once in the morning on an empty stomach, and once before bed). I was surprised at how potable the mixture was. I began the ACV and stopped taking the Aciphex on Monday morning. I am overjoyed that it is now Friday and I have zero symptoms of the reflux. Prior to this, if I ran out of my medicine, I would be in excrutiating pain within 48 hours. I wouldn't call myself sured yet (I am still nervous it is going to come back), but I am amazed and excited about the results thus far. Thank you everyone for the excellent (and hopefully life changing) recommendation!!!
5136	91	6106	Steve from Memphis, TN	2009-07-09 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I'm not big on natural cures, but my acid reflux was so painful for about 3 years I was willing to try anything. I was in the habit of taking Pepsid Complete every night before bed and the drug worked fine. I had no problems if I took the pill. But I decided to see if there was another alternative ... so I decided two weeks ago to give ACV a shot. This was a difficult step for me, because I have never gone to bed without the pepsid complete for the past 3 years. To my amazement the ACV works wonders. I have only had a couple of minor issues with acid reflux this past two weeks, and amazingly I have not had in trouble at night going to bed when the reflux would really attack. I take two teaspoons per 8 ounces of water 3 times a day ... and the acid reflux is getting even better. I haven't had any issues the past two days. Thanks to all for the suggestions ... I can tell you it worked for me. I will now browse through this site and see what else I have been missing out on. Steve
5137	91	6107	William from Seattle, WA	2009-07-03 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Apple Cider Vinegar works for me. For a year I had been going to a doctor for my stomach problems, first acid reflux, and later, stomach pain, bloating, throwing up, not sleeping, and finally constipation. As some of you might guess, it was the PPI (little purple pill) that the doctor was prescribing. (to bad you were not my doctor!) We did all kinds of tests to try to figure out what was wrong with me but I was always told to keep taking my little purple friend. And true, I did not have acid reflux anymore, I was just miserable. My last exam, a lower GI let the doctor give me the good news, "I don't have cancer." He sent me home with saying, "We still don't know what the problem is." After another few weeks of throwing up my dinner and having trouble sleeping I started search the internet for others with similar problems. (I'm a little slow) Yes, it was the purple pill and those wonderful side effects the doctor doesn't mention. So I went off the pill and tried the apple cider vinegar. IT WORKS, YES IT DOES, IT WORKS. I take a teaspoon with 8 ounces of water and a little honey, once in the morning and once in the afternoon. I have been taking it for two weeks and found it works great. I am amazed. I never take these kind of home remedies or organic solutions, but, it works and that's all I care. What have I learned? My doctor sells expensive tests and doesn't listen and I need to take control of my health care. Bill

My throat got raw plus I was unable to sleep. The ACV after 1 week seems to help some as long as I eat an apple before I go to bed and take 2 tums. I do have a questions though-why am I so tired now. It seems that each day I get extremely tired and I'm very restless at night. It's almost like I've run 10 miles even thought I have a desk job. Does anyone have an answer or a remedy. Could it be that I'm going thru detox?
5140	91	6110	Rob from Portland, Oregon	2009-04-16 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I was on PPIs (gastritis) for around 10 years. I've taken them all. Decided to give the ACV a try to get off of Nexium. I'll be a monkey's uncle, this is the 4th day off and I feel OK. The second day rebound was hell but a little zantac quelled it. The main thing is this acv keep the acid from splashing back up. I don't know/care why it works but it does (at least with me.) I take a tablespoon 3x daily with 8 oz water. It took me about 2 weeks to work up to this level. I started off slowly and a very weak solution (around 1 teaspoon a day with a lot of water.) Too much would make me nauseous. It may be too early to tell if this is a long term fix, but going off Nexium was unthinkable a month ago. My inner alarm clock keeps reminding me to take my purple pill, but I don't need to! I am a little pissed at my doctors and drug industry at this point. All that $$, all that misery could have been avoided by drinking a little vinegar? Wow!

My Dr. prescribed me prevacid then librax but none of them help. I purchased a Acid Reflux Report over the internet and ACV is one of the cures from acid reflux. It doesn't make sense since ACV is already acid. I went to the nutrition store and hesitantly purchased ACV. I followed the instructions... to make the story short, acid reflux is gone and I just hope it's all the way through. ACV will now be part of my diet.
5143	91	6113	Noelle from Tampa, FL	2009-03-22 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	ACV cured my acid reflux (and made me smell like roses!) ok, maybe not roses, but it definitely stopped any sort of bacterial growth that caused my body odor. i take acv orally, 2 tablespoons per glass of water, every morning and two hours before bed. i was diagnosed with acid reflux at 12 and took pills off and on but i feel so free. Apple Cider Vinegar freed me naturally! I also keep the acv in the shower and before i turn on the water i put some music on, pour the acv all over my body (i pour a little in my hand and then rub on my body), dance around for 2 minutes and then spend my shower rinsing, NO SOAP!. after the vinegar smell goes away i towel off and go about my business. every deodorant ive ever tried has let me down, time and time again, but this stuff-i love it! i ride my bicycle 10 miles a day commuting and i sniff and sniff and check and check and nothing-no smell at all, its a beautiful thing. i want to shout from the rooftops! These pharmaceutical companys tell us that we have to use their products, their chemicals- and we dont! we just need to go back to nature.

5145	91	6115	Lita from Tampa, FL	2009-03-15 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	i am 58 in good health taking no prescription medications and experienced a sour stomach, queasiness, and nausea a couple nights ago about 18 hours after eating dinner the night before. i almost vomited and did not because i was swallowing to avoid it. i could taste the acid in my throat and had the upset stomach for about 5 hours and could not sleep half the night. when i felt well enough, i went online to see what may have caused the sour stomach and came to my conclusion upon reading about tophology (combining foods) that i was mixing fatty steak with salad with too acidic a dressing. i read the reasoning behind this inefficent digestion is caused by hydrochloric acid released by the stomach to digest the fatty steak was counteracted by the alkaline stomach reaction of the stomach to digest the acidic dressing cancelling the digestive action of the stomach, causing the sour stomach. i always thought i pretty much had an iron gut since i do not even get gas from 'gaseous causing foods', but attributed it to getting older. So today, i practised eating small quantities of food in single food categories, ie fruit, vegetables, bread and not mixing. the last thing i ate was a grilled ciabatta roll, which is not even an acid reflux causing food, but i actually got that lump in the throat feeling, and then a bit of acid taste! so then i go back on line to research a natural remedy for acid reflux and came upon this site about apple cider vinegar and off i went to the grocery store. upon returning, i immediately drank a mixture of 1 tbs acv, 1tbs honey, and 8z water and was 90 percent relieved in about 15 minutes. in about an hour, all signs of acid taste were gone and i ate dinner of a salad made with olive oil and acv dressing and spareribs, a similar dinner to what caused my sour stomach in the first place with the exception of using the apple cider vinegar in the dressing instead of balsamic, and i feel great. thanks for the remedy that really worked for me. i guess i will see if i need to take it as a precautionary measure or as a remedy, but at least i will know that it works. thanks a million for this website!
5146	91	6116	Sherri from Los Angeles, California	2009-03-14 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I suffered with severe acid reflux for several years, waking up from a sound sleep due to choking on acid in my throat! I used tagamet, tums, and Nexium. I came across a home remedy site and found out that using acv helped a lot of people. I bought some raw organic acv at the health food store and put a tablespoon in 8 ounces of water and added a tablespoon of honey and drank it. I couldn't believe that the heartburn and acid reflux just disappeared within 10 minutes after the very first drink. Not wanting the calories of the honey on a regular basis, I now leave the honey out and drink the vinegar & water through a straw to avoid getting it on my teeth. I don't understand why doctors don't suggest using acv instead of Nexium. As long as I drink the mixture twice daily, I have no problems at all and can eat anything I want. If I eat something that I know used to trigger the reflux (like chocolate or something fatty), I sometimes drink a little acv/water right after eating. This has been such a relief for me.
5165	91	6135	Keran from Cocoa, FL	2008-11-08 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have suffered for over 20 years with acid reflux. Prilosec used to work when it was prescribed and not able to be bought over the counter. I suffered morning noon and night. Just taking a drink of water in the morning would trigger the acid reflux. Tonight I was so fed up with drinking baking soda, that I typed in "home remedies for acid reflux disease" and hit this site. I immediately drank ACV with water and cannot believe the burning is gone. When I get up in the morning, before coffee I am going to drink it again. WOW what a relief it is, so ironic, I am saying that, isn't that a slogan for a commercial that doesn't work?? I am in heaven. Just so you know, my husband wanted to have sex today, but I was in so much pain from the disgusting pain of acid reflux, I had to pass, but after the ACV treatment, I invited him to bed!!!!
5147	91	6117	Angie from South Pasadena, CA	2009-03-10 00:00:00	QUESTION	7	0	Dear ACV - Reflux fans:I would really appreciate some feedback!! I've had terrible LPR for two years. I got to the point where I had to take four prilosecs a day while abstaining from all acidic foods, caffeine, and fat. Still I had a terrible time swallowing and felt like I had a lump in my throat. The worst part was the constant need to swallow. It was embarrassing, people would ask me why I kept swallowing every two seconds. After reading so many testimonials on this website I was ready to give it a try. All I had in the house was Trader Joes Organic ACV. I took 1 1/2 tsp in about 6 oz of water and it cleared up the lump in my throat and let me sleep that night without taking my usual two prilosecs. And I slept comfortably. The next morning I took 2 tsp. Interestingly, I tested my urine with PH strips before and after both times and both times, remarkably showed that I was off the charts alkaline compared to acidic before taking ACV. Anyway, that day my lump in throat was good but I had the worst case of hypersalivation I ever had. Was it because I was nervous about the ACV? Was I not drinking enough ACV or does the ACV only become alkaline in your bowels but acidic in your esophagus? If anyone can answer this I would love to hear. Also, I just bought _____s this morning so if I tried it again I would use that instead. Recently I started taking 60 mg of time released Prevacid, called, " Kapidex". It has been a week and it keeps the acid from backing up into my throat when I lie down but doesn't do anything for the lump in my throat and I'm starting to hypersalivate again though not as badly as when I was taking ACV. I'm going to get scoped in about a month and not sure if I should stay with Kapidex for a little while just to heal my esophagus or if I should return to ACV. And if so, at what dose. Thanks so much for taking the time to read my entry. Sincerely, Angie

5149	91	6119	Martha from Orange, Texas	2009-03-01 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Hiatal Hernia & Acid Reflux: While pregnant with my 2nd daughter I got heartburn with everything I ate and was drinking a bottle of Maalox a day. After she was born it got a little better, but then worse again until everything including water gave me heartburn. Also I began to have reflux while sleeping and I would wake up after breathing the acid into my lungs. I was pretty scared to sleep lying down so I started sleeping at a 45 degree angle to prevent that from happening again. I started xray school right after my daughter was born and during the 1st semester of training I saw all these people having Upper GI tests and were prescribed medications but people kept coming back because the meds weren't helping and that's when I decided to look for a solution naturally. I was told if you took a tablespoon of ACV when you had heartburn and the heartburn went away then you needed MORE acid and not less and the pills the docs were giving people STOPPED the production of acid, but you need that acid to help digest your food. I also assummed I had a hiatal hernia because sometimes my food felt like it didn't want to go down and stayed in my throat. After learning about the ACV treatment I did that for about 3 months. It was hard to drink it everyday but I did. I also cut out sodas, sweet tea, and tomato products as these things caused severe heartburn. I kept searching and talking to people and found a company that made food enzymes. I switched to food enzymes for about a year. My hiatal hernia and heartburn went away and I started sleeping flat again. That was in 1995 and I haven't had the problem again. I've told lots of people to try the ACV or food enzymes because I now know for sure that the meds people are put on are not the solution - oh I know it fixes some for a while but then the body is unable to get the vitamins from the foods they are eating and they come back to the hospital for a CAT SCAN to see what problem they have now. Since I work in a hospital and see the day to day problems that people have due to medication or Drs. who are simply overworked and most know nothing about nutrition, I go the natural way for everything. This is a great website and at least when people are searching for a solution they will try it, but I find that people look at me like I'm crazy when I tell them a simple solution to their problem, especially if it is going to mean they can't just take a pill and the problem goes away.

The first day I drank a full glass and did experience bloating and pressure so decided to sip it instead. It took two days to get full results but I persisted and have great results now. I sip about 2 cups over the day. But I have also started to watch my diet, controlling spicy foods and other foods that seem to irritate my system (including caffeine, for me). I've told a few other people about this "cure"!
5151	91	6121	Jason from London, UK	2009-02-17 00:00:00	BETTER BUT WITH SIDE EFFECTS	4	0	Hi there, I was suffering very badly from Acid Reflux a few months ago and had to carry rennie tablets everywhere with me when I had attacks. I looked for natural cures on the Internet and found this site. I mix the ACV with some juice and it worked great, at first. I have started to notice that I have been getting very constipated recently, and the only change in diet is me using Apple Cider Vinegar. I must take ACV to cure my heart burns, then I will get constipation as a result of it & this will then make my acid reflux even worse. It is a vicious cycle that I don't know how to get out of. I have two choices: 1 - Stay without acid burn pains and feel nauseas, bloated, sluggish and constipated all the time or 2 - Stay with the acid burn pains after I eat anything and have no constipation Any help you could provide me at all?

I was on nexium for about 3 years and on prilosec for about 5 or more. After reading about all the harmful side affects with long use I was desperate to find a natural cure. I found this website and it is quite a blessing to me. I stoped taking prilosec completly on Feb 1st and started taking 2 teaspoons of braggs organic apple cider vinegar in 8 ounces of water the next day. The first day i took it when I woke up about a half hour before eating anything and I had no symptoms of acid reflux till yesterday. I think I messed up by taking it after I ate. I still have mild heartburn but Im willing to suffer with it and try to make this work! Any other things I should try? let me know! Thanks
5153	91	6123	Philip from Sparks, NV   USA	2009-02-07 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I tried Prilosec for the required 14 days, the next day it was worse then when I started, then I tried an off brand made in Israel it worked for 14 days, but my relux came back. So a guy at work was telling me about Apple cider vinegar, we had the Trader Joe's with the mother and I fiqured I'd give it a chance. I started with 2 tablespoons in 8 oz. of water at breakfast, lunch and dinner, I quit taking green tea in my thermos and started taking ACV and honey to sip on all day, I'll have to say I am a believer, I have no signs of reflux at all, plus drinking this I'm starting to feel better over all. I am going to add some cayenne to help with overall health. It's nice to know that a natural, God breathed apple can heal the body. Have a great day and God Bless

5155	91	6125	Dan from Holland, MI/USA	2009-02-02 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	It is the day after the Super Bowl, and after consuming several beers, a few mixed drinks, buffalo wings and nachos, I slept all night with no heartburn. About a week and a half ago I found this site and decided to try the ACV cure. I had been living with heartburn and acid reflux for years and taking ranitidine for it. But it became less and less effective. I tried Prilosec OTC and it helped for the two weeks that I took the pills but once I stopped, the heartburn returned. So much for lasting 4 months! Then I was back to ranitidine. Now, I'm not sure I can attribute it all to the ACV. I have also been exercising regularly; watching what and when I eat (except for yesterday); lost some weight; as well as eating apple slices, honey, and the yogurt with the probiotics. My approach is this: get my digestive system working normally and deal with any heartburn if and when it does flare up. The ACV, honey, and yogurt are for fixing my digestive system, the apple slices are for any flare ups. The only caveat I have is that the Prilosec is still in my system and will be for about another month. I am very pleased with the results so far.

Dentist said it is bad for tooth enamel. Went to ACV tablets but got a headache everyday and Acid Reflux came back. Now, trying _____'s 2tsp w/8oz water and 1 tsp honey. Chewing sugarless gum with Xylitol and hopefully that will protect my enamel. Anyone tried this? Either way, it's better than Prilosec which caused many other problems. Thanks for your site! It's great!

The doctor put me on Nexium, Protonix and lastly Acidphix. NONE OF THESE THINGS WORKED. I only got worse. In total frustration, I went to the internet to search for a NATURAL cure. I found a remedy which worked immediately. I eat a red delicious apple everyday and two if needed. I found Earthclinic and started using Apple Cider Vinegar. When I have a episode, I put a tablespoon in a 1/4 cup of water and down it..... REFLUX is GONE. The ACV did what the doctor and DRUGS could no do. TRY IT. Shelley in Miami

Its only been 2 day but its starting to work. Since to me the 2 teaspoons of ACV in a glass of water tastes like lemonade without sugar (I actually like it), I think if you give to children mixed with some lemonade it may work. Also, based on other's email, in addition to the ACV when I started to feel I was getting the reflux (before going to bed), I ate an apple and it actually helped me get rid of it.

So I have a lap band for several years already - lately my trouble with acid reflux got worse and I thought the symptoms like pain behind my sternum, extreme tightness in my throat even down to my esophagus was caused by a too tight lab band, but my surgeon ensured me after reviewing my x-rays that my lap band and the way it is placed and the way my stomach pouch is located is just perfect. So he agreed that the discomfort, PAIN, and nightly suffocation attacks indicate a acid reflux problem and he gave me a prescription for Apo-Omeprazole.

Because I was laid off from work the state run insurance decided that I did not need the Acid Reflux med. They said I could use the over the counter stuff. After 6 months of agony I went to the internet and found the acid reflux remedy. It has been a great relief to me and it also has cleared my skin which really surprised. I use the apple cider vinegar to rinse my hair too. I have been using 1 teaspoon to 8 oz of water. I use about a 1/4 cup of vinegar in a large 20 oz cup water shampoo and the rinse with the vinegar.

Was placed on Nexium and had horrible side effects. My esophogus is throbbing constantly. I have had all the tests, stress tests, chest x_rays,upper endoscopy and Chest CT--all came out ok. I went off the nexium 15 days ago and the rebound was miserable--the side effects are still there----ringing in my ears, tingling in my legs,dizziness, etc. I have been on the apple cider vinegar remedy for the last 15 days. It helped a little at first but the discomfort is back. The throbbing in my esophogus and not sleeping is the worst. I definitely believe that the vinegar does help some people but I'm not so sure about the really tough cases like mine. I would sincerely appreciate some feedback as I have no intention of ever going back on the nexium. Is 15 days on the vinegar remedy long enough to expect at least some improvement? Thanks for the help.

Not only did it taste terrible, but it gave me the worst, sudden attack of diarhea EVER! Great remedy if your problem is constipation. Not so great for acid reflux.

I was suffering from acid reflex for years, as far as I remember - I kept on taking TUMBS to ease the pain every time I got A.F problem. I got some sleepless nights and that burning sensation - sucks!!! Recently I was surfing the net for some organic remedy, I found this site - So I tried ACV (two teaspoonfulof ACV with water). And oh boy, it works!!! Thank you so much for all the help and you guys made my day. Organic is better than some chalky and dry medicine...yack!!! Cheers to all!!!
5168	91	6138	Mary from Raleigh, NC	2008-09-23 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have been suffering with acid reflux for about a year and a half but didn't want to take the PPIs. I have taken Nexium, Aciphex, Prilosec, etc. but nothing worked for me. In fact, some of the meds made my symptoms worse. I started seeing a naturopathic Dr. and it helped to some extent, but didn't alleviate the symptoms entirely. I would wake up several times during the night and finally had to elevate our bed about 8 inches, which my husband had to get used to. This helped too, but still was waking up with symptoms. Yesterday i was searching the internet and found this site and i saw the ACV comments and decided to try it. So i mixed a tablespoon of organic ACV with a cup of water and added some maple syrup for sweetening and drank 1 dose at about 6:00 pm and another before bedtime. Last night was the first night in MONTHS that i have slept thru the night and felt rested. It was awesome! That pain behind my sternum has disappeared and i don't feel that "hairball" in my throat anymore. I took another dose this morning and feel almost "normal" again. I can't believe what a difference this is making for me! I am so thankful that i tried this. I was almost at the end of my rope with these symptoms and just could not take the meds anymore. I've actually heard from some naturopathic folks that acid reflux is actually a LACK of stomach acid. Don't know if that's true, but it makes sense if the ACV is making the symptoms disappear. I plan to continue with this therapy and hope that it will continue to work.

I JUST READ THE INFO ON THIS SITE AND RAN TO TRADER'S JOE FOR IT. I TOOK A 16oz GLASS WITH 2 TBSPNS AT NITE. IS GONE! I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE. ALSO MY ITCHY NOSE STOPPED!! THIS WAS DUE TO ALLERGIES. I'M NOW DRINKING THE 2TBSP W/1LTR OF WATER TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS. THANK THE LORD FOR THIS SITE AND BLESSINGS TO YOU ALL THAT THOUGHT OF THIS!! ** one tiny thing: My upper right lip started tremoring as soon as I finished with the 16oz glass. By morning it looks like cold sores where coming out, but they were dead! No pain, no itching, no redness. They were gone by 8:00am. The lip still tremoring, though, any thoughts...?

Now I am taking 1 teaspoon in the AM with 8oz of water and I am good for the whole day. No more meds, I am free. This really does work you need to give it a chance. If you get the burning start with less than a tablespoon because you may not need as much, like me. Go on give it a try. It is worth the try to be free from meds and that knife pain in your stomach. Let us know what happens.

5173	91	6143	Dana from Los Angeles, USA	2008-09-09 00:00:00	BETTER BUT NOT CURED	2	0	I have been on omeprazole for about 6 months, after an endoscope revealed an esophageal ulcer. It healed after a couple of months, and I've been trying to wean myself off the pills ever since, without success. So I tried the ACV, first time about 5 days ago, and so far, so good. Now, my question is this: Do I need to keep taking ACV? If so, for how long? Forever? Or does it "reset" the stomach to go back to "normal" amounts of acid production? So in my mind, a "treatment" would necessitate taking this continually, whereas a "cure" would mean that you take it for some duration, then you are able to stop taking it without further symptoms. And second question: I have been unable to find a consensus about dosage. I have been taking two teaspoons about 4x each day, spread throughout the day. This seems to be working, but is there a better, optimal protocol? thanks Dana

I have been scoped and my throat looks bad. My pain is contolled as long as I dont eat junk foods,foods in boxes,bags,etc. No alcohol or chocolate. The problem sneaks up on me when I cheat, some crackers, corn chips, etc. It doesnt take much,,, then I am in huge break through pain. Unrelenting pain that zaps your strength. I can max out on rolaids or gaviscon..without relief. Seems as tho the alkaline products don't help me one bit. Last night (after eating a no cheese, no meat mexican veg fahita and 2 hand fuls of corn chips, no alcohol), I was in massive,unrelenting pain that woke me up at 1 am, could not sleep, found your site at 2:30 am. Took 2 tbls of B__gs organic ACV. Felt a little odd at first, but no worse. So I took a second dose of ACV and By 3am I was pain free. Took a while to get to sleep as I was so keyed up from the pain. I write this to encourage others, seems as tho some are helped by acidic products such as ACV, mustard, pickle juice, olive juice, etc)
5176	91	6146	Kristi from Peoria, AZ	2008-08-20 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Apple Cider Vinegar has been my miracle cure! I began to suffer from acid reflux this past winter when my gall bladder decided to stop working properly. The pain, weight loss and sleepless nights were making life for me and my family miserable. The side effects from the doctor prescribed PPI's were worse than the reflux. After reading posts from this site in June, I ran out and bought Apple Cider Vinegar supplements from my local health food store. I just couldn't stomach drinking the vinegar straight. After the first supplement, my stomach felt a little calmer, but I thought perhaps it was just wishful thinking. Each day I continued on with the ACV supplements (1 with each meal), and each day the reflux improved. I can now completely control my reflux with ACV supplements and diet, staying away from my trigger foods as much as possible. Sometimes I forget to take the supplements at each meal and still no problems. I also take digestive enzymes and probiotics to aid digestion since my gall bladder has been removed.
5177	91	6147	Robert from Toronto, Ontario	2008-08-17 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	My wife had been suffering from severe chest pain from acid reflux for about a year. Almost every night, no matter what she ate during the day she would have some extreme attacks. As her husband I wanted the pain to go away, I felt powerless. So we went to 4 different doctors all prescribed medication that didnt work, ranitdine 150mg and 300mg, Losec, Prilosec, Nexium, Prevacid and Protonix. Not one of those medications worked, and with each new medication, I kept telling her that it would take about a week to work, I just lied to her) to get her off my back. But I felt so emmasculated, because there was nothing I could do for the pain. Finally I read a book on nutrional healing and it told me to take Apple Cider Vinegar, to increase the acid and normalize. I didnt think much of it at the time, mainly because for the last year we thought she had too many. But one evening she woke up, she said she couldnt breath and was having the worst heartburn of her life. I Didnt know what to do, so I ran to the 24hour grocery and picked up ACV. Gave her a Tablespoon in a glass of water, and the pain went away in a few minutes. And for the first time in about a year she has been able to sleep an entire 8 hours without waking up. I can't believe Doctors dont know about this, and if they do why do they prescribe medication that clearly doesn't work.

I did and had the worst heartburn ever. But I continued to take it. After about a day or more the pain went away and I was able to get along fine. I think if people would continue the treatment or put one tablespoon of Vin in 8 oz of water it would cut down the pain. I still take it when I have too. Every once in a while I take a generic Zantac which helps. I am still a great believer in natural remedies. I am now looking up the sites for ACV, honey and garlic to help in helping to get my body under control with weight and cholesterol. Just on garlic tablets, my cholesterol came down 20 pts in 6-8 months. Thanks for letting me share about ACV & honey. Leland

I started out taking ACV twice a day for two weeks then switched to one Golden Delicious apple a day. I have now been off the medications for two months. I am forever in debt to this website. Thank you. Alex Valley Forge, PA.
5180	91	6150	Jane from Noblesville, IN	2008-07-27 00:00:00	BETTER BUT NOT CURED	2	0	I am, at this very moment, trying the ACV cure for Acid Reflux. I developed reflux symptoms after a greasy meal 3 months ago. I don't eat much grease and I guess it was a shock to my system. I've been on Aciphex for 3 days and today I felt worse than ever. I really do not want to take another pill so, after reading all the praises of ACV and honey, I'm giving it a shot. I also have anxiety/panic disorder and the Aciphex and pain from reflux has made it much worse. I bought a bottle of ACV 3 weeks ago. Without reading about mixing it with water and honey, I just tried a spoonful of it and couldn't bear the taste so put it away. I'm desperate tonight as its 2:30 in the morning and I'm in such pain I don't know what else to do. I only used about a teaspoon in a cup of water, and a big squirt of honey and I'm sipping it. The taste is not great, but bearable. Part of my symptoms are esophageal spasms from my esophagus trying to keep the acid from leaking out. And today I have this horrible lump in the back of my throat that feels like a ball of acid. I've gotta say, I think I'm feeling a bit better from it. I will continue to take it 2 or 3 times a day, as well as the apples. I just can't take another PPI. I sure hope this works. Thanks so much for offering me some hope of a natural cure.

It's not just good for acid reflux but for other things in your body. Every Morning 1 tble spoon ACV plus 1 package of emerg C in 8oz. of pure water, been acid reflux free 2 years and counting.

The ACV burns my throat terribly, BUT the 1st 2 nights... I did not have reflux. However the other times I have used it my stomach instantly became bloated and I got really bad pain in my stomach. I really am looking for a natural cure...so any tips or advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks :)

ACV - worked wonders for me an effective relief in no time. i still hope it to be a permanent relief from the annoying pain of Acid reflux. I shall continue for a week or two. Another temporary but effective relief from acid reflux is half a glass of cold milk mixed with another half of cold water, drink it fast for immediate relief.
5185	91	6155	Scott from Thatcher, UT	2008-06-08 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I had acid reflex really bad. My doctor put me on Prilosec. I was only suppose to take 1 every 24 hours. I was taking 2-3 a day. I was working in Alaska and someone told me to take a teaspoon of ACV in the morning and one at night. I received immediate results. I have not had acid reflex for 1-1/2 years now. I tell every one about the benefits. Drug companies only relieve symptoms and do nothing to cure disease. I also had high bad cholesterol and my Doctor wanted to put me on medication for that. I have changed my diet, began taking supplements and am currently not on medication for any past ailments. I am 55 years young and am getting younger an healthier everyday.
5186	91	6156	Jules from Hampshire, England	2008-06-07 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I had been having my lunch which consisted of salad plus a raw carrot. I managed to eat half of the carrot when I started to get pains in my stomach. As the day wore on it got more painful and my cheeks became flushed. I had to be sent home from work where I went to bed for 5 hours where the pain eased a little but the acid was very nasty in my throat. I then decided to surf the net and came across your site and read all the postings from people who had used ACV to get rid of acid reflux. It also said that my stomach wasnt making enough acid that is why i needed to drink the Appple cider vinegar. I immediately went to the shops and bought some. I added 2 tablespoons of ACV to 8 ozs of water and within ten minutes the pain was gone. I have heard of ACV before as I dabble in complimentary therapies but not to cure this ailment. It certainly worked for me. Thank you all for posting your findings to help others.

I started having reflux after I had a sore foot and was prescribed 600 mg of Ibuprofin 3 x daily. prior to that time I could eat anything. After a couple of weeks of the large dose of Ibuprofin I could not eat anything without severe Reflux. After using antacids for a long time I tried 2 TBS. per 8oz ACV to Water 1/2 hour prior to eating. It worked better than all of the antacids to releive the symptoms and the reflux slowly went away.

5190	91	6160	Laura from Calgary, Canada	2008-04-24 00:00:00	NAY	1	0	Hi, I have been suffering with reflux for almost 4 months now, and I feel I have tried almost everything. I read on this site that ACV was a miracle, so yesterday I went out and bought some from my local health food store and tried it. I have never had such severe reflux as after I took the ACV, and the night time was even worse! I am still suffering today, and now have a pain in my stomach that I haven't felt in over a week. I am glad that this remedy gives so many people relief, but if you are trying it for the first time, please be careful. I used 2 tablespoons in 250ml of water, but I would suggest maybe halfing the ACV and doubling the water the first time, just to be sure you don't have the same reaction I did! I have heard good things about ginger juice for ulcers and reflux though, has anyone tried it and was it successful? Thanks!

I IMMEDIATELY BEGAN LOOKING FOR HERBAL REMEDIES. WHEN I CAME ACROSS THE APPLE CIDER VINEGAR REMEDEY, I HAD TO TRY IT. I WENT TO GNC AND FOUND APPLE CIDER VINEGAR CAPSULES AND WITHIN A COUPLE OF WEEKS MY ACID REFLUX WAS CURED.

5192	91	6162	Painfree from Salem, Oregon	2008-04-20 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I can still remember that evening when I was in so much pain. I could not lie down at all. On several occasions I have had to brace myself up against the wall to keep straight so I could handle the excruciating pain from my naval up underneath my chin. I would try not to swallow because when I did the pain was hard to bear. Yes, I had been examined and I was told I had a condition called acid reflux. One night when I was in pain I felt a hard knot right between my breast-bone, it scared me, I thought it was a tumor. That enlargement is what took me to the doctor that next morning. At first the pills prescribed to me had worked, not completely, but enough so that I could function in my day to day living. But soon my lower esophageal sphincter, that muscular door that usually closes was not keeping shut and the things I ate and drank moved backward into my esophagus from my stomach. A condition called a Hiatal hernia had allowed food and drink acids to back up into my esophagus and gave me extreme heartburn and chest pain. I am writing again to say that it was on that one blessed night of 11/9/2006 that Earth Clinic had saved me from surgical repair. Thank you again and again. ACV really works for me. I have not had pain for one year, six months and eleven days (18 months, 11 days.) Today's date is April 20, 2008. I have never had to undergo surgery. My hair is full and shining, my skin is moist, my health is great and I am still sleeping the full night long. Yes, it is a YEA, and as I had said in the year of 2006 I must say it again: "God bless this site and its creator (s), amen, and amen.
5193	91	6163	Julie from Orlando, Florida	2008-04-09 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Hello, I suffer from Severe Acid Reflux and EE. I tried probably 6 kinds of medecine and stayed on Prilosec for about 7 months. Now, it is not working again and it is giving me worst symptoms. I decided to stop it and use ACV and water. So far, I feel better than before. I did some research and found that Prilosec can have a lot of side effects including UTI (I have had 2 in the last 2 months), insomnia (I have been taking Benadryl every night to sleep) and skin rashes (which I also had). I beleive these could be related to the prilosec, I'll see if these disapear soon, and will let you know. Thank you for these free remedies. I'll keep you posted!

5195	91	6165	Sherri from Los Angeles, CA	2008-04-02 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I just found your site 4 days ago. I have been suffering from acid reflux for more years than I can remember. I tried all of the over-the-counter medications and a couple of prescriptions (Prevacid and Zantac 300). The Prevacid actually did help me a fair amount, but when my health insurance stopped, I could no longer afford it and the acid reflux worsened. I was surprised at first to see Apple Cider Vinegar as a cure for acid reflux. I thought vinegar was acidic and that would seem not to be a good idea for someone with reflux to ingest. But I was desperate and when I noticed the huge number of people whom it worked for, I decided I had to at least try it. I had nothing to lose. It cost almost nothing ($2.00 compared to the $165.00/month for the Prevacid).

5198	91	6168	Mary from Marlborough, MA	2008-02-26 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Apple Cider Vinegar helped my chronic acid reflux and heartburn. I've been suffering from stomach pain and acid reflux for over 4 years, no doubt because of all the asprin and ibuprofen I've taken over the years for headaches, and later, arthritis. I used to have a cast-iron stomach - not anymore! I started taking antacids every night, which helped a lot. But I couldn't go a single night without them.  I didn't like the idea of any daily medication, even over-the-counter, but I couldn't get any sleep without it. About a year ago, I caught a TV show on Natural Cures - on which it was said that a teaspoon of vinegar will cure heartburn.  I tried a teaspoon of balsamic vinegar right out of the spoon - it was like someone lit a match and threw it in my stomach.  So much for that bright idea. Onward with the antacids. Over time the stomach pain and reflux got worse, and nothing was working anymore.  But I still couldn't get thru a night without the antacids or it got even worse.  I was about to go to the doctor and ask for Protonix at my husband's suggestion - they're working for him.  But I don't want to be tied to a daily prescription with all its side effects, so I did a search for natural remedies just to see if something healthier could work.  I found this site, and learned that what works is apple cider vinegar in water - that makes more sense than balsamic vinegar straight.  I picked up some organic ACV and tried 1 teaspoon in half a glass of water.  I felt better within minutes.  A night or 2 later I had stomach pain, and was about to run for the antacids, but I tried the vinegar first.  In minutes I felt much better - I forgot to take the antacids.  I've been taking between 1 and 2 teaspoons of ACV in water 2 or 3 times a day for the past 2 weeks, and haven't taken any antacids since.  It's the first time in years I've been able to go even one night without then and not get woken up in under an hour by stomach-burn or reflux. Needless to say I'm not about to ask for Protonix.  My stomach's not perfect yet, but it's a lot better.  By the way, my arthritis hasn't flared up since I started ACV.  It's too soon to tell, but it could be helping that too!  So relieved and so grateful.
5199	91	6169	Sriram from Thrissur, INDIA	2008-02-16 00:00:00	NAY	1	0	After reading so much of positive feedback regarding ACV on this website, I decided to give it a try. I mixed one teaspoonful of ACV into half a glass of water. Hardly had I gulped down one mouthful of this liquid, I suddenly developed a Very Severe Acid Reflux and unbearable smarting pain in the throat. I felt as if my mouth, throat, stomach all were on fire. I was literally shrieking with pain and running and hopping all over the place. I had to take tons of allopathic medicines to get over this Acid Reflux episode (which didn't seem to go away that easily). After this incident, I vowed to never again touch ACV all my life! I am surprised how so many people seem to be using ACV for, among other things - Acid Reflux!!
5200	91	6170	Joyce from Porter, Texas	2008-02-05 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have only been suffering with acid reflux for a few months now and have no idea how anyone could stand it for longer than that!  I've only been on Zegerid about 2 weeks and it's like I'm not taking anything.  After reading the stories I've read I don't plan to keep throwing money away on some prescription.  I thought, what the heck,  went straight to the store on my lunch break today and purchased some acv.  I'm not as patient as some people it seems...I want some immediate relief!  I mixed it with water and just drank it.  (I'm getting the raw honey on my way home).  Seriously, it's been about 15-20 minutes and some of the burning is gone already!  If this works I will be so happy to have found this information!!! A friend of mine was taken to the emergency room 2 days ago with numbness and tingling and the diagnosis was acid reflux!!! I will be telling her about this.  I pray this works because this is a really miserable condition to have.
5201	91	6171	Cheryl from Franklin, MA	2008-01-18 00:00:00	BETTER BUT NOT CURED	2	0	I have not yet tried the ACV but plan to do so today. For those few who say that their symptoms get worse with ACV those people truly have too much stomach acid. ACV only works on those who do not have enough stomach acid and have been diagnosed in error. I first heard of ACV in relation to acid reflux from a show on PBS - Brenda Watson's H.O.P.E. and that was what she said. If you ever get a chance to read her book or see her video she is amazing. So if ACV does not work for you - you truly have too much stomach acid. IF it does - you do not have enough.

5203	91	6173	Juergen from West Palm Beach, Florida	2008-01-14 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Apple cider vinegar cured my "Global Sensation" caused by Acid Reflux. For the past two years I was getting more and more heartburn. My doctor subscripted me the "Purple pill" which started to work. But I didnt like the thought of paying $130 for 30 pills every time. After a view months I developed "Global Sensation". It was like a piece of food was stuck in my throat. That went on for about two months.Not even The"purple pill" took care of that. Finally I surfed the internet and found Earthclinic.com and was reading about acv. I immediatly went to the store and got organic acv unfiltered. I took two table spoons and mixed it with water, which I don't recommend. It's much better with apple juice. After one hour I was totally reieved of my "Global Sensation". It was like a miracle. Ever since I am a firm believer in ACV. I haven't taken any medication ever since. Thank you earthclinic.com!

So, last night I purchased a bottle, and this morning took the recommended dosage.  Immediately I became nauseated and have been so for the last 3 hours.  I have burped ACV for the last 3 hours.  I'm glad this works for others, but it is not for everyone.  It only made my acid reflux worse, and I feel as if I'm going to vomit any second.  Yes, I have eaten and had plenty of water.  The bottle is going in the garbage can.  Glad it wasn't expensive.  Good luck to the rest of you.

5207	91	6177	Rachel from Chicago, IL	2007-12-26 00:00:00	NAY	1	0	I have some questions. I have acid reflux. I am also a singer so this is a curse. I have been trying the acv for nearly a week now (despite the awful taste) and hoping for a miracle. How long does it take to see results? I have been diluting it in cranberry juice and taking 2 TB 2x daily. If anyone has any ideas to improve the taste, by all means. It is really hard to swallow this stuff. I gag each time. Also, is adding the baking soda dangerous for people with high blood pressure? I have read pickle juice is also effective for people. Has anyone (particularily singers) had any luck with this? Are the health benefits the same for white vinegar and acv? Any info provided would be much appreciated.

I was always going to the doctor to get my Nexium prescription renewed..I am lucky I have government insurance and thru my employer because 100$ a month for these pills is ridiculous!  I decided I needed to look at a new solution as I was concerned that these drugs over long periods of time would eventually cause other problems...I found your site and I went out and bought a bottle of ACV with the mother and that very fist day I took it I didnt need to pop a purple pill before I went to bed..today is only the second day so I am hoping that this relief is not short lived!! if this stays the way it is working now I am so thankful I was able to find this miracle! I feel better after only 1 day and I actually had red wine last night and still had no heartburn!! this is no joke ACV is amazing and anyone sick of your doctor pushing another prescription for the pharmaceurtical cartels should take this and drop them like a bad habit!

5210	91	6180	Laura from Orlando, FL	2007-12-06 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	About 6 months ago, I suddenly woke up with severe nausea and constant burping.  Everything I ate and drank made me feel sick.  I woke up nautious and went to bed nat ious every day. My quality of life started changing.  I did not want to go out anymore and do things because I constantly felt sick.  Being newly engaged, this really put a damper on my relationship.  Who wants to be around someone that feels sick everyday and to be honest..when you are sick everyday you reach a point where you just want to be alone.  I am only 27 years old and I felt like I had put on 10 years or more in the last 6 months.  I even told my mother if I had to live the rest of my life like this I might kill myself.  Everything made me sick.  Even riding in a car.  I had a colonoscopy which came back fine.  I then had a scope done and showed that I had erosions all in my stomach, throat, and esophogas.  I have been on prevacid and aciphex, which did not seem to help at all and the constant burping was just nasty and embarrassing.  I got online and found this site and figured I would give the ACV a chance.  This is only my 4th day and oh my goodness thank you god!!!  I am  not nauseous anymore.  Riding in a car no longer makes me sick.  If I burp it is one good one instead of a million tiny ones and I have energy like I haven't had in years.  I have lost 3 pounds in a few days and I am not having bad cravings.  I also notice my skin looks better. I also have battled depression for a long time and I actually feel happy.  I woke up at 4a.m smiling thinking why am I so happy.  This is truley amazing and I can't wait to keep taking it and see what else it does.  If you have battled acid reflux believe me I know how horrible it is.  Please just try this and you will not regret it!!!
5211	91	6181	Peggy from Salt Lake, Utah	2007-12-02 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I tried one of the acv remedies posted for acid reflux, and it did work almost right away. I am still hurting as the pain and rolling in my stomach and chest was horrible and constant for days. I even lost weight because I was afraid of food since' everything hurt me. What I wonder though, does the acv cure the reflux or just treat the painfull symptoms? If it only treats the symptoms then I would be reluctant to go off the omeprazole as it reduces acid therefore it reduces risk of backing up and causing damage to the esophagus. If anyone has asked their doctor this question and knows the answer I would love to know. Please post my question. I can't thank your site and it's readers enough for the valuable information I recieved.
5212	91	6182	Tim from Kent, WA	2007-11-18 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have been on acid reflux medications for a year and a half. First I was on Ranitidine, then Prevacid, then Omeprazole, which I take each night just before I go to bed. I also have been using HCTZ and Lisinopril for high blood pressure. Recently, for about 6 weeks I got very sick. I felt dizzy, nausea, headache, and lost appetite completely. I went 5 days with almost no food and lost about 10 lbs in 10 days. I changed diet, tried everything but nothing worked. At the end of this episode I would get the "feeling" of high fever in my head plus headache. I also felt very cold and had to crank up the heat quite a bit. However, every time I took my temperature it was totally normal. If I took Advil or Tylenol for headache it didn't do anything because I really didn't had a headache or temperature, it was something else. In addition to all this, I also had severe itching all over my body as soon as I went to bed. It lasted for about 30-60 minutes. There was no redness or any other marks on my body.....just plain itching. My doctor finally told me to get off of Omeprazole. The next day was a new day in my life. All the symptoms were completely gone as if were never sick in the first place. The nightly itching also went away completely the night I skipped Omeprazole. My doctor correctly predicted that it may take up to 7 days to get rid of all the symptoms. Well, on the second day some of the symptoms came back but at half the strength and things got progressively better each day. The bad thing was that my acid reflux really started to bother me the second day (48 hrs after quitting Omeprazole). I had lot of chest pain and rumbling activity in my stomach.... like a little storm inside my stomach. Unlike other people I do not have heartburn from acid reflux. I have chest pains in different part of my chest or sometime stomach. I also experience bloating and gas. I found earthclinic.com and tried 1 tsp of Apple Cider Vinegar in 1 cup of water and it worked immediately. Three hours later the acid reflux came back and I experienced a lot of discomfort. I took another dose (1 tsp in 1 cup of water) and the rest of the night was perfect with no problems. The following day I increased the dosage to 1 TBSP of ACV in 1 cup of filtered water 3x a day just before each meal and have been using this dosage daily. So it took practically took one day for ACV to do its magic. For the past 10 days I feel I have acid reflux totally under control. My blood pressure is also going down every day. I expect to be off of blood pressure medication soon. As an added bonus the acne on my back is finally under control. I was on antibiotics for 15 years until I found a supplemental milk shake that helped me get off of antibiotics for the past 3 years. I had to stop using it to figure out what was causing my sickness and the acne flared up again. I read about hydrogen peroxide on this site and that worked amazingly well on the acne on my back. So the combination of hydrogen peroxide and ACV is working great. I do feel some affect of ACV on the back of my tongue or sometimes in my throat. Luckily, in 10 days it is not too bad, maybe because I only use 1 TBSP instead of 2. My doctor has approved ACV and said that it doesn't have any harmful affects so I am free to try it for acid reflux. However, the doctor clearly said NO BAKING SODA because of high blood pressure. I see that baking soda and sea salt is mentioned a lot on this site to help reduce the acid taste but some of us can't use baking soda or salt. Does anyone have any suggestions? If you do, please email me. Because of sugar I would rather not use too much honey or apple juice if I can help it because I am taking this 3x times a day but if I have to then I will. May be I can add only a little bit apple juice in water rather than adding ACV to apple juice directly. Not sure if that's OK. If you could share any personal experiences in this regard that would be great. Thanks.

If I do not take them with my meals, I will start the burping, sour stomach, and I even have pain in my right shoulder from the acid reflux. But, within an hour of taking the ACV tablets, I soon get relief. This has been MY CURE, since I was taking a OTC before which gets quite expensive. If anyone reads this, trust in your own gut to tell you if it works!

I have taken prilosec and ant acids as if they were candy, the pain would go away for a short time but always came back. I actually seemed to be getting worse over time as a result of all the over the counter meds. I bought Natural Cures by Kevin Trudeau for my father in law. We decided to look up acid reflux to my suprise the cure was Apple Cider vinegar. I have taken 16oz over the last 10 days....what a great taste, however my pain is virtually gone and I have been eating all the food I love to eat.Try it it really works.
5215	91	6185	Jo from Whitefish, MT	2007-10-23 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	i was in agony for a week and felt like i could hardly breathe with a lump in my throat. i hadnt slept in 4 days cuz of some foam gurgling into my throat. i diagnosed an acid reflux situation but the regular sites gave me a grim view of what traditional medicine had to offer.  finally in a state of delirium i found this site.  i took the remedy and 6 days of agony was reduced by half within 5 minutes.  hours later i took a second dose and within 24 hrs i was completely healed and feeling better than before even. i will take this magic potion as a health supplement even when i don't need it for heartburn. great energy booster! z0mg! THANX!

I am a 62 year old woman who suffers from arthritis and acid reflux. Every morning I mix 1 tbls ACV with 1 tbls raw honey in a 16 oz glass of lukewarm filtered water. I do the same thing at night time. Only I mix it in 6 to 8 oz water. Otherwise I would be up all night. My arthritis pain has gone away and I no longer suffer from acid reflux.
5217	91	6187	Eileen from Fleet, Hampshire, United Kingdom	2007-09-13 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have only been suffering with acid reflux condition a few months.  Having come across this site I read peoples' entries with great interest - here were folk who had known/knew how it felt. Over the counter indigestion cures no longer seemed to be working.  I have bought the apple cider vinegar, taken a small amount after each meal and miraculously the whole bad indigestion cycle has completely vanished!  Now I enjoy a good night's sleep as I used to.  Thank you everyone for your helpful insight into a condition that was really beginning to effect my general well-being.  All this while, the cure for me was sitting on the shelves of my local supermarket!  I realise it may not work for everyone but I am grateful to you all for letting me know about it. Best wishes and good health to all.

I immediately went and drank the ACV and water only (no baking soda) and I couldn't believe for the first time in weeks, I didn't have that constant burning feeling in my throat. This morning I work up and read more on the site and now I want to try the baking soda also.
5220	91	6190	Paige from Omaha, NE	2007-09-03 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	try this: *4 inch piece of ginger root, unpeeled and scrubbed. *1 cup of filtered, organic, apple cider vinegar. *3/4 cup of honey *2 quarts of filtered water. Blend well!! I have been drinking 1 cup in morning and 1 in afternoon. Been on nexium for 7 weeks with no complete relief. Tried this 4 days ago and been able to eat anything but I would still advise to watch what you eat. Stay away from the trigger foods and drinks.

I was getting terrible panic attacks along with it because it feels like I'm going to have a heart attack. I found this website and tried I TB of ACV in a small glass of ice water and had almost instant relief. It has now been almost a full day later and the reflux has yet to come back.  It is truly amazing. This will now be a part of my daily regime.

I get symptoms ranging from severe nausea, laryngitis, heartburn and now gagging during the night. Nexium didn't cure me (though it healed my esophaugus), Pepto makes it worse, tums do nothing. All I've been doing lately is propping my pillow and barely eating. I'm 23 years old and I can't enjoy myself half of the time because I want to throw up.

I have tried the acv remedy for my LPR and my muscus in my throat is gone, swallowing easier and no more coughing. Is my bad breath(halitosis) related somehow to my LPR? If so, what could I do for the condition.
5225	91	6195	Joe from Beaumont, California	2007-08-10 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Wow! I do not believe it! Had a double by-pass in 2004 and have been on blood pressure medication and medication for acid reflux for years. After I had some side effects from both medications decided to try ACV and garlic pills. Although my blood pressure without medication was only 135/85 my doctor wanted it lower than that because of health history.There was no doubt in my mind that ACV and garlic would not work! Well, dummy me! It worked and worked big time! I have waited 2 months to post my story because I wanted to be sure. Had appts with two of my doctors yesterday and my blood pressure wast 110/72 and later that day 106/70. The big bonus for me was my acid reflux disappeared. I take 2 tablespoons of ACV in a glass of water and a 6,000mg pill of garlic every morning. Try it! You have nothing to lose. It worked for me and hopefully it will work for you.I also should add that I monitored my blood pressure several times daily to make sure it was working. Good luck

For over a year now I have been taking 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar right before bed and I have not had problems since. The doctor was going to put me on medicine for my acid reflux, and since I started taking the acv, the medication is not needed.
5227	91	6197	Sandy from Sevierville, TN	2007-07-31 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Thank you so much for your advice about ACV. I have been taking ACV with digestive enzymes and have hade IMMEDIATE and CONSISTENT relief from acid reflux. My regular doctor gave me Protonix, and the GI doctor gave me Zegerid. He did not listen when I said I wanted to make lifestyle changes and not take meds. He scoffed at ACV and could not believe something acidic could help with stomach acid. After lots of research, I have found the side effects and long term damage of acid pump inhibitor drugs are not the first choice. The ACV and digestive enzymes work GREAT! For intense acid, Dr. Andrew Weil recommends DGL, and I have found a product called VAXA helps reduce the acid and restore pH levels. I take a digestive enzyme and 2 tablesppons of ACV with juice before each meal. Be sure to get raw ACV with the "Mother" or its natural enzymes. I take the ACV pills when traveling. I have told family and friends of this wonderful and inexpensive relief. Thanks again for being there afer hours of online research and providing hope.

5229	91	6199	Jean from Los Angeles, CA	2007-07-09 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Hooray for EarthClinic! I had a runny nose, dry, hacking cough, clearing my throat continually which caused me to lose my voice. Finally diagnosed as acid reflux and given many nose sprays and pills which helped. Did not want to be on meds so when I found your site I was thrilled. YES !!! ACV works. Just a tbsp in 1/2 glass of water before breakfast. If mucous reappears, I take 3 tmes a day before meals. No pills, no cough, no runny nose. Thank God for you and the people's voice on the Internet. P.S. Don't understand why one would take baking soda with ACV. Seems as if that would cancel out the goodness.??

5231	91	6201	Karen from Buena Park, California	2007-06-28 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Why do you need more acid when you seem to be suffering from acid reflux? Because you are not producing enough acid to digest your food. So your system goes into overload and your body produces too much acid, hence the acid relux and indigestion. Finding the right balance to digest your food and suffer no more from the reflux is as easy as throwing away the mylanta, maalox, pepcid and others. Taking these only reduces the acid you need to digest food and the vicious cyle starts all over again... producing too much acid. ACV before or in the middle of a meal will create the needed balance or betaine hydrocholoride pills from a health food store will also work. After 2-3 days you be in pain no more, will eat what you want and you will sleep great. More people over 40 do not produce enough stomach acid. For 3 years I have been pain free because of the betaine hydrochloride or AVC if I am out of pills. They work!
5232	91	6202	Coleen from Buffalo, Missouri	2007-06-23 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I don't usually write anything back but after taking the apple cider vinegar I felt I had to. I have had very very very bad acid reflux that has gotten worse over the yrs. to the point that it seems any food as soon as it is in my mouth I start with the burning burning burning. Belching....my husband says I do this all night long. I could not sleep flat any longer for I would just throw up in the middle of the night. Not to mention I have not had much sleep for I could NOT eat 4-5 hrs before going to bed! I had trouble swollowing, and have a constant cough, that I have been told could be cancer of the asophegus? When I heard that... I started taking the acv, that very night I slept "normal" and the next morning I had a good bm (which is another problem) Within a few days all my symptoms were gone and it has cured several other ailments as well not to mention loosing weight! I hate the stuff (taste) but you can't ignore the miracle it is. I just think more people should be talking about this simple remedy for sooo many things, what else could it do? I think the list goes on and on. ps. My ph level used to say "consult a physician" to now being normal. I have more energy too!
5233	91	6203	Sid from Queens, NY	2007-06-14 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	ACV worked form me. I provides instant relief from heartburn. I had reflux for over a year. I had an endoscopy done a year and a half ago revealing a scared esophogus. I was put on the purple pill for 3 months. When I cam of the pill, wow what rebound. Eventually I read about ACV and tried it. IT DID WORK! Why are there not clinical trial being done on this? There is enough anecdotal evidence this works. I think the reason there are no clinical trials being done is that they are expensive and no one will make any money if ACV if scientifically proven to work.

5236	91	6206	Kishor from Melbourne, Australia	2007-05-22 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I'had suffered with acid reflux last year about this time. I had used all types of antacids and lastly the "purple pill". They didn't work out for me. I was searching for the remedy and came across this website. I have tried apple cider vinegar for ten days and my acid reflux symptoms were gone. But again this April, i felt like acid reflux symptoms and used ACV for around two weeks. Now i feel relieved from reflux symptoms. I would strongly recommend the use of apple cider vinegar before trying any other pills. Lately, i have been skipping meals due to work load. this could also be one of the reasons of acid reflux.

At first my taste buds had to get use to it, it does gives you an tingling feeling on your tongue and down your throat, but the results is worth it.

I bought the Apple Cider Vinegar and have been off the purple pill ever since. I started taking it 3x/day and am now down to a convient two. The cost is nill compared to my previous route and I am sure my digestive system is thanking me. I take it with water and use a straw as this is easier on the teeth. NO REFLUX!!!!
5239	91	6209	Caroline from San Diego, CA	2007-05-05 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I obtained acid reflux after eating some really spicy food in February of 2007. Here it is May of 2007 and I still have acid reflux and wake up at least once a night. My dad had recommended the apple cider vinegar cure and I thought he was crazy. Since it is pickled, which I was told to stay away from, I was scared to try it. I tried it today and my acid reflux has stopped burning me. Please note, that I have not had releif since this acid reflux occured. As of last week, I also found out that apples make me feel better, so I am eating apples too. In regards to drinking I drink Gatorade and Water, but wish there were other things I could drink. Thanks to this website...I didn't think of "apple juice." That's great! If anyone else knows of any other beverage that is safe...please let me know.

I tried just swallowing a teaspoon on apple cider vinegar and low and behold. It worked. I was told that vinegar neutralizes acid and acid reflux is caused by too much acid in the stomach. So soon we get old. So late we get smart.
5242	91	6212	David from Avon, IN 46123, USA	2007-04-22 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Apple cider vinager has reduced my acid reflux and the positive proof of killing all of the bacteria in my bladder came from a lab test when I thought I had a prostate infection. The doctor looked at the results and said my urine was so remarkably clean, (without any bacteria) she did not know what I had. Therefore, she sent to urology and it was discovered I had too much acid in my system. Much of it was too much coffee, orange juice and grape juice plus ACV. When cutting back on too much juice, my prostate symtoms were gone in a few days, but the proof of " no bacteria in my bladder" was reason enough to let others know the benefits of AVC. All bladders have ... cells floating around and that causes bladder and kidney infections. AVC can prevent that. DJS

My Niece told me to take apple cider vinegar. Well I tried the liquid out of the bottle and I think that was worse than the A.R.! Well a trip to the health foods store made me very happy! Apple cider vinegar tablets! They are a must! I can control my A.R. if I watch what I eat and quantity. I do take a lot of Advil for my back problem. I think I will stop that and see what happens. I am sure the apple cider vinegar helped me! I take it every day, and if I'm careful of what I eat, I don't have a problem. Try it- you have nothing to loose except Acid Reflux!

He took prescriptions that were very strong and costly. He just didn't think their was anything left to try. I suggested he try apple cider vinegar capsules according to directions on the container. A while later he is raving about how well he feels and how all of his prescriptions for various health problems are put aside. I urge people with stomach, intestinal and high blood pressure problems to try acv, they won't regret it. God bless.
5246	91	6216	John from Fountain Hills, Arizona	2007-04-15 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Seven days ago I was ready to put a gun to my head. I was continuously waking up, had difficulty breathing and swallowing. My self diagnosis search led me to this web site. I started taking two tablespoons of' ACV and a quarter teaspoon of baking soda in about 4 ounces of apple juice.It actually tasted pretty good. Some relief was almost immediate, but one week later I am thrilled to report 2 consecutive good nights sleeps of about 7 hours. This is the best I have slept in two months as the throat problems caused me to snore badly when I could get to sleep. My wife has welcomed me back from the guest room, which I am also thrilled about. I have osteoarthritis which I WAS using a combination of CELEBREX (4 OR SO A MONTH) and IBUPROPHEN(whenever I wanted)I would get up in the morning and enjoy 6 or 7 cups of coffee on an empty stomach, then eat and have 3 or 4 diet sodas during the rest of the day. BAD BAD BAD. So I stopped the coffee and sodas, started taking B complex, large doses of Vitamin c, L Glutamine and traded the coffee for herbal teas, and the sodas for juice. NO MORE IBUPROFEN Tylenol only if I need it. Bottom line: In a week I feel totally different, much much better actually. THANK GOD for this web site. I wish you luck if you have a similar situation to mine.

5250	91	6220	Patti from Cambria, California	2007-03-24 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I feel compelled to add to the chorus of the healed and almost-healed from the torture of Acid Reflux. Like many others, I have spent time in walk-in clinics, doctors offices and emergency rooms with symptom of acid reflux which were never diagnosed as such. It wasn't until my last encounter with an emergency room doc that I was finally diagnosed. Of course, I was put on Prevacid, and like many others, began to feel better until I began to feel worse. Going off the Prevacid intensified my symptoms and I found this website touting the benefits of apple cider vinegar. I bought some ACV and some wonderful local raw honey and 3 times a day I have been putting 2 Tablespoons of each in half a glass of water and taking it after each meal. I have also been taking a probiotic enzyme capsule with each meal. As of this morning (5 days into treatment) I am free of heartburn, the lump in my throat is gone, my energy is back and I am eating normally again. Yea!!! Thank you, everyone who has contributed to this site. I hope my experience will help as others have helped me. I intend to keep up with ACV regimen, as I absolutely love drinking it after a meal. If you have just begun taking ACV or are considering taking it, I must say to you that it did not help immediately for me as it seems to have for others. It took a few days to begin to feel relief. Stay with it. It works!

I always thought that it was related to stress and the extra weight that I have been carrying. I realize now that it is probably due to ibuprofen use. I suffer from headaches 2-3 times a week and the ibuprofen was the most effective pain relief that worked for me. Occassionally I would take 3 pills at a time in order to get relief. For the past month I have been taking 2 tsp. of organic vinegar with 2 tsp. of honey mixed with a cup of hot water 3 times a day. I am also watching my caloric intake and have noticed a dramatic difference in the way I feel overall. I have not had a headache since and my acid reflux is no longer a problem. I am convinced that the vinegar/honey "tea" is responsible for the significant improvement in the way in feel.

Second off, there is a $3.99 cure, that ends acid reflux in just three days... period... it's called... "Raw - Unfiltered Organic Apple Cider Vinegar, with the mother", one brand name is "_______", and I hope they don't get greedy... and keep the price as is... 9 years ago, taking Bayer Aspirin for a head injury, I developed an ulcer and almost died... then for 8 years took "Dr. Prescription Prevacid" however you spell it... sorry about that... then after years of taking the doctors prescribed medication, with no cure, at $130.00 a month, because I don't have insurance... I read the book by Kevin Trudeau, "Natural Cures Revealed..." now for the past 6 months, I have had ZERO acid reflux at all, I take a tablespoon when I wake up, and one before bed, and that is it. Talked to a seals person at a GNC store today, who said he had researched this 3 years 4 months and a week ago, and told the same story... the Apple Cider Vinegar not only stopped the acid reflux, but cured it.. I feel the same way... I have no more and I can eat ANYTHING I feel like it. There yea go... thank you.

I just wanted to get the bad taste out and acid back done the esophagus and it worked. Someone told me about vinegar for fungus, because my daughter had a ringworm. In most kid this get out of control. I prayed about it and sought out help from the school nurse on the best thing to do for it, but the nurse wasn't in and one of the ladies the work there told me what she read about vinegar on the internet because her grand daughter was prescribe meds that didn't work. Well, I know for my self it works. I use the vinegar first then the meds for the doctor. In my eyes the natural way is the best way.
5255	91	6225	Don from Los Angeles, CA	2007-03-03 00:00:00	NAY	1	0	I have tried acv for about three weeks now with little success. I had a problem last night. When I use an extra pillow it seems to work but forgot to last night. I also have arthritis and acv mixed with raw honey has helped so much I have stopped taking syn-flex, a remedy with unknown side affects. I will try the acidophilus. Thanks
5256	91	6226	Theresa from Louisburg, Kansas	2007-02-27 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I was told about your site about a month ago. I had had the stomach flu for 2 weeks and my digestive system was a mess. I read about ACV and started it that day. I haven't taken Nexium since. I have told everyone about the site. I take a "swig" of the APV with "the Mother" twice a day. I can't believe it, but after a month, I would say it works.
5257	91	6227	Vina from Calgary, Canada	2007-02-27 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I've used Apple Cider Vinegar for several years now whenever I get an acid reflux attack. It immediately takes the pain away and I feel 100%. Years ago I used the ACV with baking soda for heartburn and it worked as well. After reading some of the comments on this site. I will try using the ACV on regular basis for my blood pressure. This week I will start visiting the Fire Department on a regular basis to be checked for my blood pressure. I'll keep a record of the numbers and get back to you at a later date. I'm glad I woke this morning at 4:10 am and started looking for natural cures. I don't believe in chemicals at all and try my best to stay away from medication if at all possible. I know my Doctor is planning on starting me on high blood pressure pills. I'll be back in a couple of weeks. Vina
5258	91	6228	Michele from Los Angeles	2007-02-15 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I started using the ACV drink recommended on these pages to treat my reflux.  Works great for the reflux, I sleep like a baby and feel great.  Only problem is, I'm dropping a lot of weight fast, and I only weigh 102 now (I'm 5'2").  Is there any way to safely use this without becoming too thin?  Thanks!

I would get no relief until I would finally vomit. UNTIL!!!! Apple cider vinegar, honey, and water. I mix up 1/2 cup of each ingredient at a time. I take 2 tablespoons in the morning and 2 at night. (refrigerate un used portions) Mix up as much as you want, just equal portions of all ingredients! Saved my life. No more tums. No more vomiting. A full night's sleep! Rebecca
5260	91	6230	Joan from Elkton, VA	2007-02-05 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	The apple cider vinegar worked for my acid reflux. I took Protonix for 2 years until my insurance company had it switched to the cheaper omeprazole. They also halved the amount from 400 mg daily to 200 mg. The acid reflux pain returned, so my doctor prescribed two 200 mg. omeprazole daily. The acid reflux symptoms lessened, but I still experienced some nausea and stomach pain from time to time. I was desperate to get off prescription medications altogether, and then I found your web site. I've been using ACV for two weeks now, and I feel better than I have in years. No stomach pain or nausea. I can't thank you enough!
5261	91	6231	Lea from Eau Claire, WI	2007-01-31 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Thank You for your suggestion of ACV for acid reflux. My Acid Reflux symptoms came on very quickly. Within a week from my first symptom, I was miserable with a thick throat...a lump in my throat. It was difficult to swallow. I tried drinking an 8th of a cup of ACV combined with about 3/4 cup water. Within 1/2 hour, I felt relief. Thank you so much. Lea
5262	91	6232	H Roberts from Windsor, Canada	2007-01-31 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Had periodical heartburn and acid reflux for last three years. Zantac worked at the beginning but later became ineffective. My Doc put me on Pantaloc twice a day and as with Zantac it eventually became ineffective. I returned to chomping on Tums for relief but I began going through a container every three days. I found this site while looking for long term effects on heartburn sufferers and found this site about the vinegar. I laughed and was laughed at for even considering such a thing. Like many of you I became desperate and bought a jug of Heinz Apple Cider Vinegar. It worked but boy did I ever get a sore stomach. Now I have two shots of it with two shots of water twice a day and the problem rarely surfaces. In fact at first I twisted my face at the taste but now enjoy it as much as I enjoy a glass of wine with my meal. I have never seen the Brachs variety but once I've drank this 4 litre jug I will try to find it to compare. Many thanks!!!
5264	91	6234	Pam from Bellevue, WA	2007-01-27 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I had the stomach flu this last weekend including vomiting. I hadn't really eaten much and was still feeling sick. I went home from work early and lied down. I started to get this horrible pain in my chest and all of the symptoms of acid reflux. My sister was just diagnosed with it which is the only reason I didn't panic and go to the Dr. I started searching on-line and glanced at something about apples. I grabbed an apple on my way out the door to get the kids. I felt instant relief. However, when I was finished it came back even worse. I stopped at a drug store and asked the pharmacist what they recommended and she said Pepcid AC. That didn't work either. I was in lots of pain and did not want to go another night without sleep. I found this site and went to Trader Joe's to pick up the apple cider vinegar. It took about 10 minutes to kick in and it completely got rid of all the symptoms. I have taken it this morning as well and felt more energy and am thinking this could replace my normal coffee in the morning. Thank you for all the stories. I am passing all of this information along to my sister as well.
5265	91	6235	James from Show Low, AZ	2007-01-26 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have found ACV to be quite helpful on relieving indigestion and reflux type pain and pressure. But everyone doesn't have the same problem, which is why PPI's work for some and do nothing for others. Many people have early stomach dumping on top of reflux type symptoms. A side note on PPI's. They do not allow undigested food to go into your intestines. Your stomach, if working properly, outside of the reflux issue is setup to empty when Hydrochloric levels reach a certain point. Until then, the food remains in the stomach, grinding away. The exception to that is the early or mid dumping problem, where the stomach is acting more or just spastic and not relating to feedback on Hydrochloric levels. The best thing you can do from I have found so far on early dumping is to not combine to many levels of digestive variance and eat smaller amounts. Sugars digest almost immediately. More complex Carbs take about 30 minutes to clear the stomach. Proteins can take 2 to 4 hours and grease can take 5 to 6 hours. If your stomach is already having a problem releasing or holding food to long, the more of these you combine at one time, the bigger problem you will have. ACV seems to help alot of people on dumping problems because it seems to reset the Stomachs start point for the digestion process. With a chronically messed up stomach, usually from overstress, the brain and stomach are bouncing all day, everyday, for probably quite some time. The connection between brain, nervous system and stomach status are messed up. ACV maybe helping this situation like hitting a reset button before you eat. There isn't much need to worry about the acidity level of ACV either. A coke is far more acidic.
5266	91	6236	Robert/35/male from San Diego, CA	2007-01-25 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Right on new years eve i was stricken down with some sort of sickness where it was a combination of a terrible sore throat and throwing up!!! To top it off i have suffered from acid reflux for quite some time. In the past i would juice some cabbage to take away the pain when it became unbearable. This time i was so weak i could not make it to the store to buy any!!! so i took some thera flu and wouldn't you know it things went from bad to worse. the acid reflux was the worst i have ever experienced in my life. I really don't know how i made it here to earthclinic.com.... but it was then that mine eyes have seen the glory or shall i say the hell of otc medications. i have since thrown all of them away. I read some feedback about acv and somehow got the strength to go to the store and get some "mothers" acv and some cayenne pepper powder as i read that it would cure a sore throat. My throat was really raw from retching and the reflux so i was a mess. needless to say these 2 work better then any other otc medication ever made...i have told as many people possible about the cures and this website!! now i can simply laugh when i see the advertisements for otc meds on tv and such.That was last week, now i seem to have a awful running nose. let me just say i have made severe adjustments to my diet. no more red meats and my one weakness CHEESE i am trying to eliminate. I just read tonight on the vapor/steaming powers of acv with water and tried it. Really quite strong, even more so then drinking it i thought. when i drink it i would have it with some organic apple juice so the taste was quite pleasant. The steaming effect seemed to open up my sinuses quickly and i will continue until all symptoms are gone!! WOW!!!like so many others i am so thankful for this website!!! please keep up the good work and let me say the feedback from others is a true testament to the effectiveness of the remedies offered here. p.s. I'm almost out of acv!!! its a great energy drink i've found... and i will continue to drink it as long as i live
5267	91	6237	Reece from Brisbane, Australia	2007-01-17 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I had Reflux for at least 5 years. in about 2001 I had an endoscopy that verified that I indeed was afflicted. I immediately went on reflux tablets at the Doctor's suggestion. I wish I never had! The pills made my reflux WORSE! Before that, it was manageable, but once i was on the pills, i couldn't go off them without horrific pain! Then I discovered this website. I went off the pills and tried the apple cider vinegar, the Dill pickles and the Jonagold apples. The one that worked was the vinegar. I started with putting 2 teaspoons of honey in a mug, a bit of boiling water to melt it, then topped up with chilled water, then put in 2 teaspoons of apple cider vinegar, and did this 3 times a day to start with, and reduced it as i started feeling better. Now, three months later, all i take is ONE glass every 2-3 DAYS! The taste becomes easier to bear too, as i now have 2 teaspoons in half a glass of water, no honey!!! Last week, i had another endoscopy, and what do you know??? THE ENDOSCOPY REPORT SHOWS THAT MY REFLUX IS NON-EXISTENT!!!!!! Thank you for this website, and I hope others will be inspired to go off the pills. :) Reece
5268	91	6238	Gwen from Faison, NC	2007-01-17 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have been battling heartburns and acid reflux for about a year. I thought I was having a heart attack. I went to the emergency room and found out that my heart was ok. I got a prescription for prilosec. I took this for a week and no relief. I couldn't sleep at night. I was having esophagus spasm.I went to my family doctor and got some aciphex.This help some but I still found myself using rolaids. I went to the health store the other day and they put on to organic apple cider vinegar. I haven't felt this good in a long time. Maybe I won't have to eat so many rolaids. I mix it with water and drink it about 15 minutes before eating. I was also told not to drink while I was eating .THis has been hard but I think it has really help to drink my beverage after the meal.

I felt immediate relief, and had a great nights sleep. Took more this morning, and felt ok till late afternoon. After dinner, I felt very bloated. How long do I take the acv before I begin to feel good all the time?
5281	91	6251	Kevin from Aveley Essex, England	2006-11-10 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Wow, stumbled onto this website last night in desperation,I have felt sick every day for the last four months and have been bringing up acid, I have been taking omeprazole with limited effect, and I now realise I have been prescribed 100% the wrong treatment. Bought Apple cider vinegar tablets this morning and took two, within 15 minutes the feeling of sickness went, and have gone all day feeling better than I have for months, this is not in my mind as I am not easily influenced or easily led, I really do feel better and cannot believe how you can get results so quickly, it really does seem that we all have a lot to learn from our past and maybe we should not dismiss new age hippies so quickly. Thanks to everyone on this site, I will promote this as much as I can.
5270	91	6240	Robert from Santa Barbara, CA	2006-12-28 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have tried just about everything! I went for an endoscopy and the gastroenterologist did not see much evidence of acid reflux. But he said I probably had it since my stomach was inflamed. He diagnosed me with gastritis. I have not been able to eat without severe nausea for the last 6 months! The strange thing is that I never get a burning sensation. I bought some PH strips and my urine PH was very acidic along with my saliva. I understand it is normal to have a slightly urine PH but mine was always very acidic. I ate lots of steamed vegetables, am a vegetarian, never drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes so I don't think my diet had anything to do with it. I think it was years of stress catching up with me. Fortunately for me, my nutritionist turned me onto ACV and I searched for more information on ACV and found this web site. After about 6 days of taking 1-2 tablespoons of ACV, 3X per day with a 1/8 teaspoon of baking soda to neutralize the ph before the major meals and my acid reflux is almost completely gone! Before I had tried ACV, I had to even stop exercising because the glands in my throat would get so swollen. Now I take a teaspoon of ACV with a dash of baking soda before I exercise and hardly experience any swolleness in my glands. Each day my condition is improving.......I honestly thought that my life was coming to an end........the nausea and sudden change to my lifestyle was crippling. I continue to take one digestive enzyme capsule with each major meal, but I used to have to take about 4 of them to just get by. I am wondering if I will have to take ACV for my whole life........since my condition is getting better with each day perhaps I'll eventually be just be on an occasional maintenance mode.Thanks so much for this website. Good luck and God Bless to everyone! Also, you can toss the prilosec into the garbage dump!......Prilosec worked well for a while but the joints in my body were hurting me more. I now feel young again!
5271	91	6241	Edie from Mission Viejo, CA	2006-12-26 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	1 Tablespoon ACV with 2 Tablespoons water a day cured my arthritis and hot flashes. My friend told my husband and I to take ACV for our sore wrists and hands and we started 2 mos. ago. After one mo. I noticed I had absolutely NO hot flashes. This amazed me. I really had them bad night and day. I also noticed no acid reflux (quit taking my prilosec a month ago) and no restless legs to speak of. I also feel I have lost a couple of lbs. Of Course the hand and wrist pain is gone. This is probably crazy but my eyelashes are longer. Pretty funny huh?

I am so thankful that this web site is available for reference to the public. I am convinced that America's healthcare costs could be reduced by 90% if people just took care of themselves and used common sense instead of expensive prescription drugs. Keep up the great work!
5273	91	6243	Paula from Sacramento, CA	2006-11-26 00:00:00	WORKED TEMPORARILY	3	0	Hello I have been taking the AVC (1-2 TBLS) with honey and 30 drops of cayenne tincture each morning. It helps to keep the Acid Reflux in check, but hasn't cured it, per se. I did try Bowen therapy which is a type of body work. Apparently there is a treatment for 'digestion'. My Bowen therapist in Sacramento did this and I had no symptoms for two weeks. They are starting to come back now, so I will schedule another appt. Tom says it is a bug of some sort causing the distress, that is why I also take 30 drops of licorice tincture. I am about ready to try the clay treatment he suggests as well. email me at pcbow @ mac.com if you want the name and address of Ralph for the bowen work. Paula
5274	91	6244	RL from Ohio	2006-11-24 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Your readers may wish to know that many people (especially women) think they have acid reflux when they actually have a lack of acid in their stomachs. Tums and soda will actually cover the symptoms but not give you what you really need. I had acid reflux symptoms and began taking a hydrochloric acid/enzyme supplement . If I forget to take my 3 tablets with a meal, I could have real problems resulting in throwing up. This usually happens when I eat meat. I even have to take my pills with my tea (with milk) in the morning or I get gas and heartburn. My elderly neighbor takes about 1200 units of hydrochloric acid per meal while I only need 300. ACV is helpful and actually gives me energy--perhaps that is why I love pickled foods. ACV is also one of those foods that is acid in nature but alkalinizes the body. Anyone who thinks he has acid reflux would certainly find it worth the effort to try ACV and hydrochloric acid/enzyme tablets before going the medical route.
5275	91	6245	Pete from Oakville, Ontario	2006-11-17 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	was on nexium for 6 months and started having really loose bowel movements 3/4 times a day, figured this was not good. Went off the nexium and 2 weeks later went back to once a day with solid stools, but then the acid reflux came back, went on the computer and found this site for acv. Glad I found it, less than a week taking 2/3 times a day I think I am cured.
5276	91	6246	Len from Chicago, IL	2006-11-17 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have been battling nighttime Reflux for about 3 years now. I am at a stage now over the last few months where I have it under control. I eat dinner at 5:30 then immediately have a desert of fresh fruit, no carbs, no cakes, just fruit. Apples seem to help me. Then I eat nothing else the rest of the night so my stomach is empty when I go to bed. With dinner or soon after I have about 4 ounces of Apple juice with about 2 ounces of Apple Cider Vinegar . Tastes good. About 1 hour before bed I take 1 melatonin pill. 10mg . A study on the net had great luck with melatonin. Then I take about 4 ounces of water with a half teaspoon of baking soda . I raised the head of my bed a little. I am now doing fine and sleep pretty well. No more major burning in my esophagus at night. This regiment works for me. Best of luck!
5277	91	6247	Newspicker from Chicago	2006-11-15 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	As a veteran TV News anchorman, I was slowly losing my voice due to a type of acid reflux disease known as Laryngopharyngeal Reflux (LPRD). After limited success with a regimen of proton pump inhibitor drugs such as Nexium and Prilosec, I discovered apple cider vinegar. The short story: My voice is back and the damaging throat clearing which had threatened my career is largely gone. I'm aware that treating a condition caused by stomach acid with an acid product is counterintuitive.. but it works! I don't believe this is a cure, and I still take Nexium once a day but ACV is far more effective.
5278	91	6248	Nancy from Winter Park, FL	2006-11-15 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I would wake up in the middle of the night feeling the symptoms of Acid Reflux & take Zantac & wait for it to work. I took 1 Tbs of' Apple Cider Vinegar before dinner & never woke up. I have been taking 1 Tbs morning & evening before eating for 3 weeks & not once have I felt sick. I'm not as hungry,I eat a third of what I once did. I have lost weight, I sleep well, I feel so good. I have also added to my diet Organic Virgin Coconut Oil, I prefer the Extra virgin but it is twice the price ( read up on it , it's miraculous.)
5279	91	6249	Michael from Marysville, OH	2006-11-11 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I found your site looking for relief from acid reflux. It was getting bad. I'd had it mildly for about 10 years and took prilosec on and off. The ACV worked right away and I am now able to eat pizza again without an attack!!! Thank you all. My only suggestion: For those who don't like the taste, I add mine to orange juice and drink it with a straw. That way I can't really smell it and I get it down fast.
5282	91	6250	Painfree from Oregon	2006-11-09 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Apple cider vinegar cured my Acid Reflux, hot flash, back pain and restless leg syndrome. Axid AR did not work, I was in so much pain, went to find out which foods that contained high amounts of alkaline in them. Tired of looking 5 months pregnant. Anyway, thank God I found this site. All I had was regular store bought apple cider vinegar and clover honey and tap water. I spooned a half teaspoon of vinegar into my mouth, about choked to death, followed with water, and then ate a half teaspoon of honey. In about 45 minutes I had no pain. I am so full of energy and do not want to go to bed now. It is 2:43 am in the morning. God bless this site and its creator, amen. Tomorrow I will go find me some ACV.
5283	91	6252	Rick from Indianapolis, IN	2006-11-06 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I'm 37 and have had acid reflux for about 10 years. Growing up, my family didn't provide healthy meals. Consequently, I abused my body by consuming unhealthy amounts of soda, candy, saturated fat and other dangerous foods. I truly believe that huge amounts of sugar, caffeine and cholesterol in my system caused acid reflux. It also caused acne. I tried antacids at first, to no avail. Then, my doctor put me on Nexium, once a day. The medication only masks the problem. I've always worked out several times a week and after a couple of years on the medication, I noticed that I was gaining weight despite my steady workout routine. From the research I've done on the internet, certain doctors say that reflux medication kills the acid in your stomach so you won't have the pain. The problem is that you need the acid to naturally break down food and impurities. The absence of alkaline in my system was causing me to gain weight more easily. After I began eating 1-2 apples each day and taking a teaspoon of apple-cider vinegar , I had no problems. I've been off Nexium for a year and a half and have no problems. I drink more water, cut back on sweets and have completely given up soda. I also stop eating snacks 1-2 hours before bed. Apples and ACV also help cleanse your system and act as a natural laxative. It's easier to loose weight if you consume it regularly. I use to have quite a bit of acne. Now, at 37, my skin is much clearer.
5284	91	6253	David from Tampa, FL	2006-11-01 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	1 part Apple cider vinegar and 3 parts water at least three times per day especially after meals has lessened acid reflux symptoms by 90% after three weeks steady treatment. I had been taking Nexium for approximately 5 years by doctor's prescription. When I went for a refill and found that I couldn't without going back to the doctor again, I decided to check out your website for help. After 5 years of Nexium and/or Zantac, if I missed taking it even one day, then my reflux came back as strong as the days before treatment. I never went back to the doctor for another prescription. The apple cider vinegar mixture treatment really works for me and is better than the last 5 years with few symptoms. I have also removed coffee and wine completely from my diet . Also, I try not to eat anything within 2-3 hours before bed. That's hard since I am a "grazer" and eat at odd times.
5285	91	6254	Alan from NYC	2006-10-23 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Listen up singers! I have had reflux for almost two years now. I have no heartburn or stomach discomfort. I have the type of reflux that only attacks my throat. Sometimes my throat burns and is sore, my neck actually hurts and I have hoarseness. This of course is a huge problem because I am a singer and right now i'm doing a 1st national tour and when the acid reflux is bad, the singing is bad. Well it got particularly bad last week and my singing was really suffering (I even got my first bad review of my career because of it). Like many others I also have gone through nexium, zegerid, aciphex, etc. They all work for about a month and then the reflux comes back usually worse. So I went on a 24 hour information search because I got to a point where I wasn't sure I could sing the show. Well what I came up with worked IMMEDIATELY. So I want to share the news. First - I stopped taking my prescribed reflux medicine. I took organic apple cider vinegar three times a day (two table spoons mixed in about 4 oz of water). I got a multi enzyme that I took before and after each meal and also after working out. And (this is a big one) I stopped drinking anything during my meals (it apparently makes digestion of food much easier when there isn't so much liquid with it). I started all this on a saturday morning and had a four show weekend. My voice came back by that matinee and it soared through the next three shows. Apparently people in the homeopathic world know all about the benefits of enzymes and the effectiveness of raw apple cider vinegar. I didn't. But now I do and I just wanted to share. It really works. Good luck. Peace.

I have had just about every test they could think of and there's nothing wrong with me. I went to the health food store and bought digestive enzymes and hit it hard for a month along with Nexium. I have been off the PPI's for about a month and just started 1 1/2 weeks ago with the Apple cider vinegar and that stuff is great! I just do a combo of ACV and digestive enzymes and I feel great. No more raw throat when I wake up, I don't dread eating anymore. And the best thing of all is I'm off of the damaging meds. Praise God!! Just had to share.
5287	91	6256	Scott from Oil City	2006-10-15 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have been suffering from acid reflux for about 8 years .I have been to the doctor and have been on all of the prescription ppi drugs,currently on prilosec otc.I always had to back them up with tums ,Rolaids ect.None work for the long term. Tried ACV two nights ago seems to work. I have also for the last year been having problems sleeping, which then gave me migraines. I had my best sleep in two years the last two nights. Don't know if the ACV had any thing to do with that , but I love the side effect.
5288	91	6257	Phillip from Sweden	2006-10-09 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Hi,about 3 years ago I started getting daily heartburn that got worse and worse.I ate rennie´s and tums like sweets and soon had to take Ranatidin on a daily basis. I visited my doctor who wrote out more prescription drugs.The drugs helped but as soon as the effect wore off I was back to square one. I read about the vinegar cure on your site and decided to give it a try. I cut back on the drugs and instead used the vinegar .I have been symptom free for over 6 weeks and feel 100% better. I can eat and drink things that were unthinkable before. A word of warning to anyone taking anti-acid drugs , the more you use them the worse your reflux will become after the daily dose wears off.The body compensates the lack of acid by producing more. It's a vicious circle that the drug companies never mention. Out with the drugs and in with the vinegar. A desert spoon in a glass of water every morning is enough to get your stomach working again. Best wishes from Scandinavia. P.S. great site

I hardly ate, I was practically starving, grumpy and miserable,weak and tired.... you could find me drinking the Pepto-Bismal,Malox,Gravol,Peppermint tea. It was so nasty I did not want to get out of BED!until my father had mentioned Apple Cider Vinegar...I doubted it at first...well let me tell you, I purchased Gel Caps from the Natural Health Food Store,and Apple Cider Vinegar, after I swallowed the pill, I felt better within 45 mins...I could not believe it! so now I take 3 Gel caps a day of Apple Cider Vinegar,and i'm happy to say no problems, and I don't have to take any gross medicine. the first night I celebrated my new found health, I took my boyfriend out for beer and SPICY NACHO'S!

5292	91	6261	Don from Ontario, Canada	2006-09-19 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	All my life i"ve been eating rolaids like candy for my acid reflux. Watched a health show on tv about the digestive system and the lady doing the show said that a lack of acid is the most common cause of acid reflux. Acid naturally causes muscles of the esophagus to close off when digesting. Hence stopping acid reflux. The lack of acids cause the food to ferment and backup into the esophagus causing burning. She suggested taking a spoonful of ACV to stop the burn. Now no rolaids just ACV.Works wonders and I feel great.
5293	91	6262	Julie from Sheffield, PA	2006-09-17 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	My father has had horrible acid reflux for years. He tried 1Tbl. of Apple Cider Vinegar with 8 oz. of water every morning - and has been reflux free ever since. My question is about my 8 month old. He was a preemie and has horrible reflux. He's on Zantac and Reglan and has even tried Prevacid - it helps a little, but he still reflux's throughout the day - even aspirating into his lungs. I was wondering if you've ever heard of babies taking vinegar, and if it has helped them. I know he wouldn't take it by mouth, but he has a g-tube through which he receives his other med. s. If he could take it how much would you recommend. Thanks!
5294	91	6263	Bobbie from Rowlett, TX	2006-09-11 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I got hooked on spicy chicken and started eating it almost everyday. At first I noticed that I got a little burning in my chest and when I coughed it got worse. The more chicken I ate the more I started getting acid reflux. I would mostly get it when I would go to bed or lay down. Today I was sitting up and got the biggest attack that I have ever had. I coughed and more acid came up. My ears, throat, and chest burned and I was getting choked and I felt like I was going to die. My husband heard all the choking and coughing and came in to help me. I had read many remedies on this site and remembered the ACV. My husband brought it to me and I mixed some with water and drank it. I started to feel better right after I used it and it about 10 minutes I was totally pain free. I'm going to use it for weight loss, acid reflux and arthritis.
5295	91	6264	Sharon from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada	2006-09-07 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	After suffering from a blocked bowel which caused back up of acid into the esophagus, many hospital visits with an NG-tube being inserted which scraped the interior of the esophagus, acid reflux was a full time occurrence. A scope showed that the lining of the esophagus was, as my Dr. said "raw meat". I was placed on most ant-acids known to man. They masked the symptoms for awhile, but I spent most days in pain. Sleeping was near impossible because of the pain and coughing. Thanks to a Dr. who practiced natural medicine and a magazine article which told me that far from having too much stomach acid, the pain meant that I was producing too little, I was told to take a forkful of sauerkraut when the pain hit and that it would help. It did! Immediately! It's effects were not permanent though. One week ago, again because of a magazine article, I was led to try Apple Cider Vinegar. Not for Acid reflux but to help me relax. I have not had acid reflux or heart burn since! Thanks for your web-site. I will be sharing my find with others.
5296	91	6265	Dr. Paul Swanson	2006-08-29 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Thanks much for the ACV remedy for reflux. I join the chorus and say, yes, it has worked excellently for me as well. It has been shown that the lower esophageal sphincter closes in response to acidic stomach liquid near it. My theory is that reflux is caused either by stomach liquid which is insufficiently acidic or because the acid receptors near the lower esophageal sphincter are not sensitive enough. Acidifying the stomach liquid with vinegar allows closure of the lower esophageal sphincter to be properly triggered by proximity of sufficiently acidic stomach liquid. This theory is directly counter to the prevailing idea that reflux is caused by excess acid. I have observed in myself that Pepcid, which reduces stomach acid, does make reflux less painful because the refluxed stomach liquid is less acidic, but that nonetheless the actual amount and frequency of reflux increases. Thus, it makes sense to me that medications which reduce acid do reduce pain but do not eliminate continued reflux and symptoms. Clearly, this explanation of reflux will not be favored by those with financial interest in selling acid-reducing pharmaceuticals. Thanks again, Paul Swanson MD

I have had several prescription medicines and was presently on prilosec. I have been on the apple cider vinegar for 3 days with absolutely no reflux. Believe me, it works!
5298	91	6267	Chris from Toronto, Ontario	2006-08-03 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Recently I was sent from work to the hospital for chest pain so bad I nearly fainted. They were not convinced that it was acid reflux. After blood tests and ekg's and a stress test they conceded that I probably have acid reflux disease and prescribed pantoloc.... it didn't help much. I was prescribed nexium after the reflux persisted and that didn't help much either. I stumbled onto this web site today and ran out to buy acv and got more relief than I have since the reflux started. Here's hoping it continues... thank you
5321	91	6289	Brandon from Grand Rapids MI	2006-04-22 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Amazing!! After visiting this site i instantly took the ACV. My grandmother was always preaching it But I never wanted to try the stuff. Well it just so happens I started suffering from Acid reflux and the doctors gave me all these drugs and none helped. ACV is the ticket. Thank God for this site.
5299	91	6268	Ricky from Walnut Creek, CA	2006-08-03 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I'm 27 and recently came across this site for acid reflux and saw all the talk about ACV. At first i thought "what a scam" but i'll try, i was desperate. I've been taking acv for about 2 weeks or so, i can't believe it but i've really lost about ten pounds in 2 weeks. I've stuck to a healthy diet, lots of greens and lot and lots of water. At first i started taking it for acid reflux and digestive problems , and it's works. I thought something else was wrong when i started dropping the weight but it's the acv. It didn't work right away but after a week or so i noticed results! Try it yourself, just remember everybody's different what works for one person might not work for the next.

5301	91	6270	Dorothy from Oroville, CA	2006-07-19 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I went to your web site to find a way to cure my acid reflux, I had been taking Prevacid for a long time, just wasn't doing anything for me in the last 6 months, so I tried the apple cider vinegar tablets, it's been two weeks and I feel so much better, can't say it's cured yet. What excites me is my out of control appetite is now in control, and right from day one, unbelievable! the weight is comming off so easily. thank you so much.
5302	91	6271	Maria Elena from Edinburg, Texas	2006-07-15 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I tried any kind that could relieve me of my very chronic acid reflux, tagament, pepcid, antacids, zantac, any medications for acid reflux. I have been using ACV for about a week and I have noticed some changes on the acid reflux. I had gotten to the point of smelling food while it was been cooked, that was enough to set my acid reflux! believe me and even when I would drink water I was having acid reflux daily and was lasting for long periods of time...it was driving me nuts and having lots of pain during the day and at night....would be up all hours of the night. I had started throwing up and could taste the acid and the bitter smell of the acid reflux... just too much for me to handle..and I don't like seeing doctors.... So I called my sister and she told me about an article on ACV and told me to try it... thank God... I listened to her. I HAVE noticed my acid reflux isn't lasting long hours into the night or lasting for days. Now I sleep at night without worrying about having acid reflux, I'm too much enjoying having a good nights sleep!! We should remember what our elders had to say about home remedies and give it a try. Try it and you'll see the difference, because doctors don't want you to see the difference.
5303	91	6272	Terr from Northglenn, CO	2006-07-07 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Well, I just want to say thank you for this great site! It has saved me, from great pain and suffering. I had to get off Nexium, I could no longer afford it. It really was beginning not to work anyway. I found this site, and instantly went to the fridge, and drank some pickle juice. Oh my gosh! Worked really well. I then went to the store and bought some ACV. What a difference! I have now slept through the night for 5 nights. I haven't slept through the night in years. I am slowing learning, that I can eat again. I used to get so sick, I could not even keep a soda cracker down. The burning was unbearable, and at times and I would be in tears. Thought I was going crazy. Anything spicy sent me over the edge, and I would be sick for the whole day and night. I no longer take any medicine, rolaids, Mylanta, etc. I also found that Celestial Seasonings makes a peppermint tea. I drink it every day, and it really helps. I am also trying yogurt, seems to help. Anyway, thank you so much for this site! I am so mad at the Drs. for prescribing medicine that just masked my problems.
5304	91	6273	Trey from Carrollton, Georgia	2006-06-27 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I broke my shoulder playing softball and was given endocet 10/325 and naproxen 500mg. A week later I realized that I had a major problem. Something was causing me to feel like I was choking. Being in great shape all my life and never having an allergy, It was very disturbing. After lots of research I found that the pills and stress from the injury had really messed my stomach up bad. After all kinds of doctors and meds, I listened to my 87 year old neighbor. 2 days of apple cider vinegar and no more problems.
5305	91	6274	Cecilia from Strongsville, OH	2006-06-16 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have had chronic lower'back pain for years and after taking AVC twice daily for a month I have noticed a drastic difference. I was restricted in activities and now I can do just about everything. While at the doctor's I also found out that my blood pressure dropped from 124/80 to 116/68. In January, 2006 I was diagnosed with acid reflux, which resulted with pills every day. Since taking the AVC I haven't had to take any medication for the acid reflux. I believe it has also helped with my allergies. This really is a miracle cure.
5306	91	6275	Lynn from Caro, MI	2006-06-15 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	6 or 7 years ago my digestion went to hell, my arthritis reared it's head and I was miserable. I kept eliminating foods and tried aloe vera juice plus went to the doctors. They put me on Prevacid, naproxsyn, and zoloft. I tried to get off all but not very successfully. I finally kicked zoloft a little over 2yrs ago. The doctors will tell you that there is no withdrawal, there is a withdrawal believe me, but that's another story. I quit the pain pills which I was on prior to my digestion woes but I couldn't stop the acid reducers. I had to change to Prilosec due to finances and if I forgot a pill I would be doubled over in pain and vomiting. I couldn't ever bend over within 2 hours after eating without food and bile coming into my mouth. I found articles about acv and tried it. Immediate relief, no pain I still belch but no food comes up and I can even bend over. I will write again after another month or two and let you know how my arthritis is doing. I like the taste of avc. I also use ginger twice a day to aid digestion.
5307	91	6276	Dee from NYC	2006-06-14 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I had a horrible few days of bloating, abdominal pain, vomiting and nausea. I was diagnosed with Acid Reflux and given a prescription for Prilosec. I took the pill and still no relief, so yesterday I did some research and found this site. I immediately went to the grocery store and purchased some ACV. I took a tablespoon before bed and I slept through the night, and I somewhat am feeling back to normal today. I know it's too soon to tell, but I'm optimistic this will help me relieve my pain! Thanks to all on this site!!
5308	91	6277	Ann from Fairhope, AL	2006-06-13 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Oh M-Gosh! ACV and honey cured my acid reflux, nasuea, a really heavy feeling and at the same time a vaccuous feeling in my stomach. ACV is a miracle!!!! I went to the doctor today and shared with him that I was taking ACV and what great results I was having......he didn't say a word....I could just tell that he was not in disagreement with this treatment. So, here I am, at 64 years old, and FINALLY able to sleep and free of all my symptoms!
5310	91	6279	Tammy from Carrollton, TX	2006-06-11 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I just put this to the test, I did 2 TBSP ACV in a cup of water, and my acid reflux went away immediately. I usually get acid every day, so I will test this again as soon as the next time comes around. My stepdad swears by' ACV. I see a lot of cures listed here that I need. I am hoping if I drink this mix 1 to 2 times a day I will see these benefits too!
5311	91	6280	KB from Chicago, IL	2006-06-09 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have acid reflux. The silent kind. No heartburn or late nights... but it was there. I sing in a rock back and it hit me after a performance. I am sure the late nights, beer, and late eating finally caught up with me. I went to the ENT, got scoped and was put on Prevacid (PPI). Did that for a month, while researching the web and anything I can get my hands on to get rid of this. I couldn't sing without major pain. We practice weekly and felt like I was letting the guys down. I found ACV and gave it a try...it certainly helped but ACV is acidic. It cures the heartburn, but since acid reflux is stemmed from too much acid coming up the to the throat... you might be adding to your problems as I did in my case. I wanted off the PPI's as that is very bad for you in a lot of ways. I found some natural cures like taking Ginger Root extract after meals and Honey when the reflux kicks up and before I sleep every night. I also drink a shot of Aloe Vera with water (you can get that at any healthfood store) three times a day. The Aloe actually heals the burns internally in your throat (just like it does for your skin when you get an external burn). I feel for the first time I actually have a handle on this. We have a gig a week from today and my confidence is growing as each day passes. My advice to this group is to do your research. There are many other things I am doing aside from what I listed above, but those specifically have helped me. Everyone is different. There are many natural remedies out there that you can look at to heal yourself and still not have to change your lifestyle too much. Just stay away from PPI's (they say Orange Peel extract is something to consider in replacement...but should be done carefully and for a short period of time - research it)...I have a feeling in about 10 years there will be a study on PPI's and how they are causing all sorts of new problems. When you think about it, the reason your stomach creates the acid is to break down food you eat before it hits your intestines, which is a good thing...PPI's basically put undigested food in your intestines to rot...not good. The main issue for everyone on this board is to just keep the acid in the stomach where it belongs...anyway...good luck...research, research, research!!! When I am 100% healed I will be back with more...till then...ROCK ON!
5312	91	6246	Len from Chicago, IL	2006-06-07 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Wow! I am astounded. After reading your forum last night, I bought some Apple Cider Vinegar to see if it would help my reflux which I have had for a couple of years. I am almost in tears as I got a great night's sleep last night after giving up hope of ever sleeping throught the night again. I can't thank you enough. I feel like I'm 20 years old today and I'm just giddy. No pain what so ever. No burning. No 3 AM gulp of Mylanta. I am angry at the doctors who prescribed all those medications that did nothing or only helped a little. I only pray that my esophagus will heal back to normal after years of injury. GOD BLESS YOU AND THANK YOU SO MUCH. If you are reading this and haven't tried it I strongly encourage you to. You will bless the day you did! Len
5313	91	6281	Rob from Sacramento, CA	2006-05-21 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	ACV really does work. I am a very skeptical person. I have lived on over the counter drugs for heart burn going on 16 years, and guess what, I'm only 32 years old. I started out with max strength Mylanta then on to zantac. I started waking up in the middle of night with acid in my throat not being able to breath and coughing so hard to get that stuff out of my throat I would throw up. I could not sleep on my stomach at all. My symptoms was getting really bad I was scared for my life. So I went to the ER they told me to keep taking zantac. Finally I was told about ACV at work this is where skepticism came in I looked and looked and researched this cure. I was really looking for a big sign saying I was a big jack ass but I went ahead and bought a gallon of ACV I finished it off took approximately 1 to 2 shots three times a day in a big 16 oz glass of water. Heart Burn is GONE GONE GONE thanks to ACV and your SITE. Thanks so much, Rob P.

5316	91	6284	Robert from NC	2006-05-04 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Apple Cider Vinegar worked for me! About 2 years ago I had reflux for about 6 months waking in the middle of the night with acid in my throat near vomiting, I'm sure you know the drill ! Tried ACV, now I use it in all my salad dressings. I Buy store brand dressing, any variety you like, and SUPER [double the bottle oz] it up with Cayenne Pepper, ACV, and whatever other herbs & spices strike my fancy as I'm doing it. Makes twice as much dressing so it's cheaper [cheap Bob]. I have a salad with this supered up dressing most nights before supper. No more problems to date.

5319	91	6287	Mark from Dubuque, Iowa	2006-04-24 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	i have been suffering from acid reflux for about 6 years now. started out with the heartburn, then got to the point were i couldn't swallow food without flushing it down with lots of water.the doctor put me on protnic then previcid, prilesac, and finally nexium for the last 4 years.i have been hospitalized 3 times in the last 2 years for heart attack like symtoms. the results have always been the same. there is nothing wrong with your heart. this last trip to the hospital on 4/18/06 the doctor told me to double up on the nexium. so i went home and did so.that night the pain in my chest was worse than it had ever been. that's when i got on the computer and typed in reflux. i found this site and after reading all the comments on acv, i felt a small ray of hope. i got up the next day and went to the health store and bought a bottle of acv. i went out to my truck , opened it, smelt it, and thought there is no way i'm drinking this. at that same time my heartburn was so bad i figured i had no choice. i took a swig of acv and drank some orange juice right after. the heartburn got worse for a minute or so, and then just like that it was gone, it stayed gone for almost 5 hours. i was completely stunned. ive been taking a tbls 3 times a day now for 3 days and i haven't felt this good in years.who ever started this web site should be thanked for eternity. thanks for all of your input. thank you, thank you!!!!!
5320	91	6288	Johnette from San Diego	2006-04-24 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I ran across your website surfing the internet. After about 3 weeks of having stomachache pains up all nite I had a very bad episode where I thought I was having a heart attack. the pain was all in my back, I was having anxiety attacks and was diagnosed with Gastritis. I went to the ER and they put me on Pepcid AC and Maalox. I was taking that for about a week when I came across this website. It seems to help but I started to try the ACV 2 teaspoon twice a day with Organic Apple juice taste great and it seems to really be helping with the Acid Reflux. I can sleep through the nite I still have the pain alittle bit but nothing compared to what it use to be, I can handle it. I will continue to use ACV. Oh, and my complexion seems to be brighter too. Great Stuff! I love it, Thanks for the insight.
5322	91	6290	Rosemarie from Worcestershire, UK	2006-04-21 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I've been taking a number of prescription meds including aspirin for years for high blood pressure and under- active thyroid. The latter is the result of radium treatment for over-active thyroid and I believe agreeuing to that treatment is the biggest mistake I've ever made! Last year, in addition to all the other medication, I was prescribed anti-inflammatories and pain-killers after I suddenly developed osteoarthritis(?) in my lower spine and knees and, almost immediately, I had crippling indigestion and reflux which prevented me from sleeping. I became afraid too eat and The medication which was then prescribed to counter the effects of the anti-inflammatories and aspirin caused dreadful insomnia so sleeping became an even greater problem. I stopped taking the anti-inflammatories and was soon unable to walk despite spending a fortune on physiotherapy, osteopathy and acupuncture . Eventually, I returned to the anti-inflammatories because they took the edge off the pain in my knees and back and I was immediately back to square one with reflux etc. I'm so grateful for the night a search on Google led me to this site. I have to confess I just didn't believe ACV and honey would work but I had some in my kitchen cupboard so thought I may as well give it a try. Usually when woken with reflux and nausea I was awake for the night but on this occasion I was fast asleep within fifteen minutes. That was about four weeks ago and was the last time I was troubled. Since then I've taken a tbsp of ACV/Honey mixture three times a day before meals and my digestive problems, if not cured, are 100% controlled and my sleep is undisturbed. Although the jury's still out on my blood pressure and osteoarthritis, I believe both may well also be improving! Not quite sure if I'm using the correct ingredients but I use any brand of organic, runny honey together with unpasteurised, organic, cyder vinegar. Both are usually sold by the main grocers and by health-food stores across the UK. I am more grateful than I can say.
5324	91	6292	Linda from LaFollette Tennessee	2006-04-14 00:00:00	BETTER BUT NOT CURED	2	0	Read your web page about natural cures. After many different drugs I had tried and not had any relief so I tried your remedy. After reading several different comments from people who had done the vinegar I thought it made sense. I also read some other information on chewing gum helps create more saliva which adds more enzymes that aids digestion. With these 2 natural things I have had about 80 percent relief! YAAAAAAAAAAAA!
5325	91	6293	Mike from Bellingham, WA	2006-04-14 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have suffered slightly from acid reflux at night over the years, had a very bad session New Years day this year. Went to doctor, he prescribed prilosec. Had 2 bad sessions in the next week, 1 during the day, undigested food sitting in the back of my throat. In desperation, I went out on the net and found the ACV & honey cure. I tried it and everything seemed to be going well, plus losing weight, etc. I still sleep through the night with no acid surprises, but I am experiencing an acid taste in my throat and mouth during the day, kind-of like a vapor. Also, the front area of my tongue, just behind the tip, feels burned most of the time. ACV & or honey will momentarily reduce the symptoms, but they come back fairly soon. Any suggestions?

I read a book titled Alkalize or Die to get a list of food PH. It mentioned that the apple cider vinegar was alkaline. I went off all heartburn medication and after an afternoon bout of reflux I tried the apple cider vinegar... a tablespoon in a glass of water. Within a half hour I felt immediately better. It was definite proof it worked and I am thrilled.
5327	91	6295	Kayla	2006-04-05 00:00:00	NAY	1	0	here's the thing I tried ACV and to be quite honest my acid reflux hasn't gone anywhere but worse, I even tried drinking different brands and still to no avail the heaviness in my chest is still there and I feel more nauseated than ever more power to the folks who seem to be feeling better after they drink ACV with a glass of water..... but I haven't see the benifits work for me.... I even tried taking ACV to even lose weight and still I see absolutely no results... besides wouldn't ACV burn the lining of your esophagus/stomach if you drink after awhile (even though one drings the organic gentle version of ACV)...just my opinion...thanks for listening.

5329	91	6297	Gwen from East Lansing, MI	2006-03-28 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	My doctor put me on nexium for acid reflux control and it only made my symptoms worse. I didn't think the lump in my throat would ever go away. I happened to see your web site and I tried the ACV treatment last night and I was actually able to sleep horizontal, instead of sitting up. I'm amazed. I did the baking soda mouth wash afterward to preserve my tooth enamel as well. This is something I will continue for the rest of my life. Over the years I have become disillusioned with traditional medicine and will continue to look for home remedies. Thank you so much for these posts.
5330	91	6298	Ann from Bmt, TX	2006-03-28 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	When I first had pain in my hands from arthritis I was 35. I read about ACV/honey as a drink, hot or cold, and drank it once a day. It helped, and I used it for quite a while. This was a home remedy for what used to be called rheumatism, and farmers mixed pure apple cider vinegar with mother into the mash for their cows to help them have healthy calves and easy births. There's a popular book out that talks about ACV for reflux, and other natural cures that has good information. I've been drinking pure cranberry juice with spring water several times a day for a year, and after a month I had no reflux at all, and begin sleeping all night for the first time in a long time. I believe the acid in any natural pure juice is good for digestion, but the natural AVC is good for a lot of other things, balancing the ph in the system. Great web site, thanks.

5333	91	6301	Mark from Fairbanks, Alaska	2006-03-26 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I took Tums for years, then aciphex for 6 years now. Aciphex worked for 5 of the 6 years. Now the reflux is back. Just started the ACV a few days ago. Seems to help some. I think I need to get with it with my diet. The coffee is a bad habit and I know it is a big part of the problem. So is alcohol..in any form. Interesting.. had to fast for a day for a EGD, and had no reflux problem while fasting.

It worked. Now I don't want to go a day without it. I also just had a colonoscopy and I was clean and clear! I feel this also helped the results. I hope my cholesterol is going to lower as well, and lose weight with this cheap and wonderful solution to so many health problems. No more prescriptions to destroy my body. Thank the Good God.
5335	91	6303	Dennis from Hudson, MA	2006-03-16 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Hi, I have had acid reflux for the past 30 years. Tried all the drugs that they could supply. All the while using over the counter drugs too. I have been on Nexium for the past 43 1/2 yrs, and about a year and a half ago, I started with heart palpitations and hot flash/sweats, breathing trouble, coughing and throwing up, etc. Many tests later, everything seemed fine. Stopped the Nexium and after 3 weeks, all my symptoms are gone, but the acid reflux came back and strong! ACV has worked for me. Thanks and feeling much healthier.
5336	91	6304	Jillian from Richlands NC	2006-03-10 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I did not actually hear about this remedy on this site but have tried the ACV out of pure desperation to cure heartburn and I am a firm believer! I had heartburn for weeks, chewed up an entire large bottle of antacids to no avail. I took 1 tbsp of vinegar and before the awful taste was out of my mouth my heartburn was GONE! It did not return for many months and I repeated the ACV dose. It's been a year and a half and I've had 4 doses of the ACV and it does such a great job removing the heartburn pain!
5337	91	6305	Douglas from Cleveland, OH	2006-03-05 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I'tried Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV) for my very painful throat and was pleased at the result (after the initial 2 minute breaking period). I believe it is the production of saliva and mucus that it enhances that is actually at work. I have supported this theory by using other astringic liquids; Listerine (gargle), orange juice and they work also. I now actively promote swallowing of saliva whenever possible. I have also started the old tradition of taking a walk after meals which seems to help the digestion. The concentration of ACV that I take is very small, just enough to promote mucus formation. Try other fruit juices and see if they work for you. Oh, and don't sit still for too long!

After all the positive feedback, I had to run out to health food store and purchase a bottle. I can most certainly say IT WORKS and almost immediately. I recently started having chest pains and trouble digesting food, it felt like it was stuck in my throat. I am blessed to have found this site, I know my guardian angel directed me right to it! Thanks.

I haven't taken a pill in two days now. It worked immediately for me. I had a very severe case before I found this cure and I wish I'd found it sooner!
5340	91	6308	Amber from Lansing MI	2006-02-27 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I was prescribed to Nexium, but due to insufficient funds, being a full time student, and working 2 fulltime jobs at odd hours, I couldn't fill my prescription. My grandmother, who is a nurse and has the same ailments was prescribed to nexium and told me one day that she would give me one to see if it helped me. Her friend happened to over hear her and told me that she was addicted to nexium, that it cured her stomach from acid reflux, but she was paying 70$ a month for it, she told me about apple cider vinegar and told me to try it. Since sticking to this for 4 weeks straight now, I have only had the pain in my stomach once, and it was very mild (most of the time before it was such an intense pain I would keel over)... Yes, getting over the taste is one thing with apple cider vinegar, but it saved me from being in pain 24/7.
5341	91	6309	Karen from Long Beach, CA	2006-02-20 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Thank you for being here! What a relief to know natural remedies do work. It's a shame physicians and pharmaceutical companies can't "work with us" (the patients) instead of trying to use us to make money for themselves. I guess that's what being ignorant (lacking knowledge) is all about. If you don't research answers for yourself, you may remain ignorant and get taken advantage of. Thank you, thank you.
5342	91	6310	Amy	2006-02-08 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	This website is very informative and quite helpful! I have been taking Nexium on and off for about 4 years now. For this past year, I had been taking 3 each morning, one hour before I ate (I had ulcers on my esophagus!!). It was working for a bit, but recently stopped working all together. Over time, these meds are not good to take because they can actually produce other stomach problems like excessive bile. This can also damage the esophagus. Therefore, after searching for natural remedies for acid reflux, I found this site. I have been drinking two tablespoons of Apple Cider Vinegar, organic or course, 3 times a day. I find that I still have a little acid, but it is much better. I also notice that my skin is looking better also. There are so many benefits from Apple Cider Vinegar. Hey, it can't hurt. It is all natural. If it helps to keep the acid away, then we will be all set. THANKS to this website, and all of the viewers helpful comments. Please keep it up!
5343	91	6311	Ainsley from NY	2006-02-08 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	It works! It works! First after taking the apple cider the acid reflux increases for about 1 minute, then eventually the pain leaves.
5344	91	6312	Donna from Atlanta, GA	2006-02-08 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Apple cider vinegar as a cure for acid reflux is a miracle. I've had reflux for years and have tried everything, you name it. My sister told me about ACV. It worked within 10 minutes. What a blessing. To hell with those greedy pharmaceutical companies. They should be ashamed of themselves.
5345	91	6313	Carol from Jacksonville, FL	2006-02-06 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	ACV cured reflux x 6 years ...arthritis....mental health. I am going to share something with you that I recently discovered. I'm sending this to everyone I can think of who may have or have family members (husbands, mothers, fathers, etc) who have issues with arthritis or indigestion. Please read to the end. I've been taking a generic Prilosec (antacid) daily for the last 6 years or so at about $39/3 month supply. Whenever I ask the doctor if I can discontinue - he says if you have acid reflux, you will just have to keep taking it. And when I miss a dose, I'm miserable. Well, I'm pretty suspicious of that drug as I think it's contributing to some health problems I have and I've never felt comfortable taking it all this time. Finally, I read where you shouldn't take that for more than 6-8 weeks as it can cause absorption issues (i.e., calcium, iron, etc.) which has caused me some issues in the last few years. So. I took the brave step and stopped the medication a week ago. RAGING HEARTBURN - like a firebreathing dragon - a boiling volcano. Nothing helped and I mean nothing. Someone mentioned to me that when they get heartburn, they take apple cider vinegar. So I took a swig one day and although it worsened things for about a minute, the reflux stayed away all night. So I researched it. The websites advise to take organic apple cider vinegar with the "mother" in it and suggested mixing it with raw, organic honey. So - off to the healthfood store. I took 2 tsp mixed with a little warm water and mixed in some honey and swigged it down the other night when I was having issues trying to sleep with heartburn. Heartburn gone - I slept all night for the first time in years. And I woke up with a feeling of euphoria - well being and an unusual feeling of peace. I'm not sure how to describe it. No joint pain - no stiffness and no heartburn all day. So I'm thinking this surely could not be from the vinegar??? After researching websites I find that others are having similar experiences. I'm just amazed. Supposedly, this drink twice a day cures: arthritis, acid reflux , allergies, sinus and a whole list of things. It is considered a health drink and has cleansing properties. Today I had a big spicy italian meal and had no issues after. If you try nothing else, try this. 2 issues to be aware of: 1. drinking vinegar can strip the enamel off your teeth so take precautions. Either use a straw when drinking all the way to the back of the throat or swish with baking soda and water really well just after. I also brush with baking soda (lightly) after. Don't take the recommendation of making a big glass and sipping on it all day. Take small amount of water and swig it down. 2. don't get regular apple cider vinegar - it is too acidic and will GIVE you heartburn. Get'ACV in the health food store. You don't really need the honey I find - but it you have allergies and you buy raw organic LOCAL honey - it will be beneficial to you.
5346	91	6314	Bonita from Los Angeles, CA	2006-02-06 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I had a cold/bronchitis for a few weeks, and then developed a severe case of acid reflux on top of that. I had a violent, persistent and productive cough, lost my voice, and was exhausted because I couldn't sleep because of the coughing. I started taking Prilosec OTC but it didn't help. Out of desperation, I tried taking some Apple Cider Vinegar after finding this site. I had immediate improvement the night I took it and was finally able to get some rest. I continued taking it once in morning and once at night, and now I'm not coughing at all and the reflux is gone. I'll be honest, it didn't feel very pleasant going down, but a few minutes after I took the first dose, I noticed improvement. Thanks to everyone who said it worked and mentioned how much and how often they took it.

5348	91	6316	Zsean from Newark, DE	2006-01-30 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Hi: my company just changed insurance plans for prescriptions. I have been taking nexium for 2.5 years and the insurance company now used will not provide me with my nexium. They have now become my doctors telling me what to take first and supposedly have levels towards nexium. This overrides the doctor authority on prescribing medication. I came across this site and I am so glad that someone placed this out there. GOD BLESS YOU. This is amazing. I do not feel pain or tired. I want to say THANK YOU!

5354	91	6322	Liz from Madison, WI	2006-01-19 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I'was diagnosed last year with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis. When I started taking synthroid I started getting severe chest pains. I called 911, went to the hospital and had several tests done to no avail. My chest continued to hurt so bad, it felt like I had an elephant sitting on me. I went back to several doctors with no luck. I never had any acid reflux type symptoms in my life. I am 50 yrs old, work out, run marathons, and not over weight. I eat extremely healthy etc, etc, etc. Then I read that having a hypothyroid disorder like hashimotos can cause acid reflux because it weakens the valve that can let acid get back into your esophagus. Well, to make a long story short, apple cider vinegar worked unbelievable. I was grabbing my chest in so much pain on such a regular basis that doctors almost had me convinced I was having panic attacks and needed to see a psychiatrist. I knew it was not panic nor stress because I have a good life, but when a doctor can't figure out what is wrong they seem to want to pass you off to a shrink as soon as possible. Thank you so much for this web site and saving my life. I use apple cider vinegar, 2tbs mixed in water every night. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you.

I came to know thru this web site that Apple Cider Venegar helps to prevent heartburn. I went to Organic Store and bought _______ Apple Cider Venegar with mother. Started taking 3 tablespoons 3 times a day. It has been a month now and I have not taken any acid reflux medicine. I tried all food from italian, mexican, indian, chinese, Greek and all sorts of cake, pie, cream or any thing you name it that might reflux did not give me any heartburn. I am very glad that ACV is working so fine.
5356	91	6324	Randy from BC, Canada	2006-01-16 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have not tried apple cider vinegar, but I have used normal vinegar, and it stopped my acid reflux for weeks. I also have a theory about why vinegar works. Whatever produces the acid in a persons stomach, for some reason, unknown to me, decides that a persons stomach needs more acid, so it produces more. I think when you add vinegar to your stomach, the thing in your stomach will stop producing acid because it knows that you are getting it somewhere else ... just a theory...
5357	91	6325	John from Spring City	2006-01-14 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have suffered from Acid reflux for about 8 years. I have had several episodes that made me sit straight up in bed with spasms and tightness in my chest. My heart rate would even increase but that was probably anxiety over thinking I was having a heart attack. The last attack I had lasted about 12 hours so I went to the Doctor. She scheduled me to see a cardiologist who prescribed a stress test, EKG and a CAT scan to rule out heart problems. All the tests came out normal. Having heard some many different people talking about this screwy cure for acid reflux involving apple cider vinegar I decided to give it a try. You can say i'm full of it if you want but it works! Forget the Tums and Nexium and previcid because you won't need them and you'll save a lot of money. I won't lie to you, right after you drink the ACV your heartburn will get worse for about 20 minutes but after that you'll be jumping for joy and praising God...it really is a miracle cure. I take a half of a shot glass once in the morning and once at night and I'm reflux free. I still feel some slight spasms but even they are subsiding. I could go on and on but I'll leave you with this...just try a couple of teaspoons the next time you feel the acid rising and see if I am wrong.
5358	91	6326	Jason from Rochester, NY	2006-01-14 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I had an extreme attack of reflux, to me anyway. I mean it burned from the middle of my chest, all the way up my throat halfway! And the pressure was uncomfortable. I downed 5 exta strength Tums...that didn't work. I took one of my wife's protonix...didn't work. So I searched under natural cure for acid reflux. your site came up after a few sales sites. So I tried ACV, and as I'm writing this, the pain and weirdness is going away slowly...a little. It's definitely not as bad.
5359	91	6327	Matthew from Fayetteville, AR	2006-01-13 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Just wanted to say a huge thank you to this site for recommending ACV. I must confess I was sceptical and didn't believe it would work. All I can say to anyone reading this is give it a try - no-one on this site has a vested interest in reccomending this - nobody makes money from the reccomendation - I believe these are (like mine) genuine experiences. I have had problems with my throat for over a year and a half. Been to numerous doctors - camera's down my throat etc - all to no avail. I was prescribed acid reducrs several times - but they made no difference so I stopped taking them after 2/3 days. I didn't believe it was acid reflux as I had no heartburn or indigestion. Just a feeling of a lump in my throat, an occasional burning sensation in my neck & all around my throat, tingling and just a permenant uncomfortable feeling - for over a year and half. Before xmas it got worse & I went to another Doctor who gave me loads of free samples of Aciphex. Started taking them on Xmas day & far from fixing my throat - I started to GET heartburn & indigestion. For 6 days it was dreadful - stopped taking the pills - but everything continued. Then I found this website - bought ACV & literally with the first dose - the heartburn went. I have been taking it now for four days & my throat is totally normal. I no longer have a cough in bed (which I think now could have been the acid reflux) and sleep soundly. It really is amazing. I never had really bad heartburn - just my throat - but now even that has gone and I feel I can start feeling normal again. I will stay on ACV for the forseeable future as frankly I have no issues taking it. Funnily enough when I think back in life I have always enjoyed vinegar - as a kid I used to drink it neat - maybe my body was telling me something!!!
5360	91	6328	Mike from Rockville, Indiana	2006-01-13 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I am always skeptical of folk cures but after several days with bouts of heartburn and several nights of acid reflux I tried a straight shot of plain white vinegar. It felt hot going down and at first I felt worse but after a minute or two I began to feel much better. I now dilute the vinegar with three or four parts water and add a little raspberry flavored syrup to make it more palatable. I have had good consistent results after drinking a couple of ounces once or twice a day. Apparently the secret to controlling acid reflux is more complicated than simply reducing the acid - some kind of pH balance must be coming into play. I can not believe the medical and pharmaceutical aren't aware of this inexpensive treatment that seems to work for most sufferers.
5361	91	6329	Rhonda from Dardanelle, AR	2006-01-13 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	After numerous doctor and ER visits and many tests for asthma-like symptoms, passing out feelling, sinus problems, tinnitus, then taking Nexium, Reglan, Prevacid, Zyrtec, Pepcid Complete and anything you can possibly think of, I had just about given up with doctors and medicine for acid reflux. Then I found this website and decided to try the apple cider vinegar and water. What a blessing! After five days, I am truly amazed. I feel ten times better than I did this time last week and I can actually hear without the ringing in my ears. Acid reflux can be a nightmare and can cause many strange symptoms to the human body. I am a 42 year old female and this has been an ongoing problem for over four years. My father lived to be 89 years old and took ACV almost every day of his life. He was a very wise man and I really think he was on to something.
5363	91	6331	Teresa from Spartanburg, SC	2006-01-12 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	over a year ago i was diagnosed with severe larynx acid reflux.it was causing sores on my vocal box,chronic coughing, post nasal drip,& etc. i was prescribed prilosec, it helped some but then it stopped working. then i was prescribed nexium which also helped some for awhile then stopped. so then i was prescribed nexium in the morning and zantac150 at night but of course this also stopped working i started taking organic apple cider vinegar 2 tablespoons at night and i am completely off of all the prescriptions i was put on. and it works better than any of the other ever did.plus my sinuses have cleared up,no more coughing,no voice loss, and as an extra plus no more hot flashes at night.
5364	91	6332	Donna from Tulsa, OK	2006-01-11 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I recently started the raw apple cider vinegar and raw honey treatment. It has helped my bloating and reflux, but I see so many variations of dosage. Currently, I mix 2 tsp acv & 2 tsp honey in 8 oz. of distilled water. I use _______'s raw ACV with 'the mother'. I do not buy pasteurized acv because the raw is supposed to have more health benefits. I drink one glass first thing in the morning and one at bedtime. I still have stomach problems but the acv does help. I am now going to stop taking the Zelnorm, I already quit taking Protonix. I'm tired of popping pills and acv seems to be my remedy.
5365	91	6333	Virigina from Wells, ME	2006-01-11 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	In August I started having a really bad cough. At first they told me it was bronchitis and treated me for that and asthma. I have been to two specialists and had a bunch of tests. I have had acid reflux for quite awhile, and been on Protonix. And the doctors said, well it could be the acid reflux. I couldn't even carry on a conversation for very long without coughing. I was sleeping with 4 pillows and ending up on the couch about 2 in the morning because I couldn't stop Coughing. I went for an allergy test, and I'm not allergic to anything. I told the doctor that I was really getting concerned because now my voice was raspy. He put a tube down my nose and said my vocal cords were red and that it was the Acid reflux. He had me take the protonix twice a day. But I was still coughing. A few weeks ago a friend of mine told me her daughter discovered vinegar for her acid reflux. I started taking 3 tablespoons after each meal. My cough is gone. I'm sleeping all night and am down to three pillows!! I'm not sure if it should be 3 tablespoons after each meal, so if anyone has the correct receipe could you please give it to me.

I was suffering from acid reflux for almost 4 months now. I had seen 4 doctors so far for this problem nobody could give me def. cure. ACV was the solution for it. I keep burping thru out the day. After taking ACV its all gone now. But I have a question for those who posted, for how long I should take ACV for Acid reflux to cure completely?

I've been taking PRILOSEC for a year and it wasn't working anymore. I found this site and am so relieved to have a good nights sleep.Thanks so much Earth Clinic for the info.

5370	91	6338	Perry from Phoenix, Arizona	2005-12-05 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Here's my story if anybody cares to read it. Labor Day 2005 my wife and I were watching TV and all of a sudden I was having chest pains really bad. i told my wife she was going to have to take me to the hospital. She had to get her clothes on and by the time she changed her clothes and said lets go I told her I didn't think I could make it so she called 911 and they were here in about 3 minutes. They treated me like I was having a heart attack. Baby aspirin, nitro etc.and I thought I was too. They took me to the hospital in the ambulance after treating me at home for about 45 minutes and I was there for 3 days and had all kinds of tests run. The next day after all those tests they told me to go home because they couldn't find anything wrong with my heart.The total bill was over $15,000.00. My primary Dr. told me he thought it was acid reflux and gave me a prescription for prevacid that cost $134.00 and I refused to get it filled. I came home and got on the internet and googled acid reflux and found this site and started using apple cider everytime I felt a 100 lb grandchild sitting on my chest (or that's what it felt like). In just a couple of minutes after taking a teaspoon of apple cider vingar straight the pain was gone. And it has worked everytime since. THANKS FOR THIS WEB PAGE AND ALL THE INFO FOUND HERE. Perry from Phoenix
5371	91	6339	Janie from Plains, PA	2005-12-04 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I thought I was having a heart attack at work the other night-I had chest pain and back pain but found out through all kinds of testing that it was just acid reflux. I was prescribed Nexium --it just didn't work for me too long--I would wake up every morning with pressure in my throat.I work nights and would have chest pain and a constant kind of pressure in my throat every night while at work around midnight,(no burning, but pain) I looked on line for a natural cure and found this site. Through advice of my friend I use 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar with grape juice. It has been two weeks now and I haven't had an episode of pain. I also don't watch my diet and I can't believe it. They laugh at me at work because I have a shot glass next to my vinegar and I mix it with grapejuice. I am not laughing because it works and it is sure alot cheaper than buying Nexium. Thanks so much for the cure.
5372	91	6340	Sammy from Newport, Tennessee	2005-12-01 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I am a 15 year old male and I was diagnosed with acid reflux three years ago I didn't pay much attiontion to it until it started hurting really bad, infact it hurted so bad it effected my school work, and homework. Eventually I couldn't handle it no longer so I went to the doctor. now here I am. The docters have given me everything known to treat acid reflux. However, the doctrs never did give me any thing "natural" simply because it would damage the profitts of these large multibillion dollar corporations. Well, as a courius young man I am, I went to Google and typed in Acid Reflux Natural Cures and after a few minutes of searching I stumbled upon this sight. Luckly my grandmother was just about to go to the local food store so I asked her to pick me up some Apple Cider Vinegar, she asked "why?" and I explained. After the 15 seconds of explaining she finally said acid reflux was effecting her also. About three hours later she came back with a gallon of apple cider vinegar. Since then I have been putting two tablespoons inside a 8 ounce cup and I quickly gulp it down. Acid Reflux has yet to bother me or grandmother since the discovery of this sight. THANK YOU!!!!!!!

The ACV has worked wonders. I've stopped the prescription Protonix completely. It's been 5 days and when I feel a bout coming on I take 2 T. in 8 oz. water and within a minute or so the intense burn subsides. My stomach does feel a bit sour for about 10-15 minutes after drinking it, but it passes and then I feel great. Truly amazing. I've only had 1 episode of heartburn in those 5 days.

5375	91	6343	Guillermo from Guatemala	2009-08-06 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I came across your web page a couple of weeks ago. I have been on acid reflux medication for 10+ years (nexium, omeprazol, etc.). I decided to give ACV a try - I bought organic with "mother". At first I used 2 teaspoons of ACV in a glass of water (I was surpriesd the taste is OK) twice a day but I still had heart burn during the day. I increased to 2 TABLEspoons of ACV in a glass of water twice a day and it seem to be the right amount. I still experienced some minor heartburn in the late afternoon but I treated this eating an apple. Since I intruduced the apple for minor heartburn I have been free of acid reflux symptoms. From my experience, the amount and frequency of ACV needed is determined by trial and error. I feel very confident on the effectivness of ACV and I am gladd to be of the acid suppression medications.

I've had GERD/bad heartburn for months (with Laryngitis)and it was making me miserable, after stumbling across this website by accident I'd thought what have I got to lose.
5378	91	6346	Mary  from San Francisco, Ca, USA	2012-06-17 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Some one posted that when she took ACV, it gave her terrible acid reflux. Another lady told her to add a PINCH of baking soda to it. IT WORKS! I gave up taking ACV before because it caused acid reflux, too. So after I read the advice to add a pinch of soda, I gave it another try. Now I can drink 1 teaspoon of ACV, added a generous pinch of baking soda and a little honey; and I'm not experiencing acid reflux. THANK YOU so much!

5381	91	6349	Guaira from Seattle, Wa	2011-08-23 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Works like a charm! Really!! I had an endoscopy scheduled because I was feeling terrible, with an acid reflux that nothing could stop. The Prevacid that I had been taking was useless. Since I had to wait about 1 month for my appointment, I stopped taking Prevacid and started taking the ACV baking soda remedy described here... I felt GREAT about 3 days into it, and PERFECT within 3 weeks. Got the endoscopy done: NOTHING!! Seriously, no inflamation anywhere, including the duodenum. Last time I had an endoscopy done I was diagnosed with a hiatal hernia: GONE! Go figure... I must warn you again though: BE VERY CAREFUL WITH THE BAKING SODA. Too much and you will end up in much worse shape. I used only 1/8 of a teaspoon, with ACV. Never measured the resulting pH, but preferred to err on the safe side. Good luck, and take care!
5382	91	6350	Donna from Nova Scotia,  Canada	2010-10-27 00:00:00	BETTER BUT NOT CURED	2	0	I developed severe acid reflux after antibiotics and prednisone for a respiratory virus in March. I was taking 2 nexium 40mg, sulcrate, zantac, and domperidone, and had a very limited diet. My acid reflux was still awful. My gastroscope showed Barrett's esophagus and severe gastritis. I had elevated liver enzymes, gallbladder attacks, severe weight loss, and chronic fatigue. Previously I didn't have a problem with acid reflux and led an active life.
5383	91	6351	Kelly from Gaithersburg, Md	2010-08-19 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I'm a 39 year old female with horrible acid reflux. I had my gallbladder removed about 10 years ago. I still would get horrible bouts of acid reflux after eating anything tomato based, spicy, creamy, or acidy (like fruit) I tried the ACV (2 tbl spoons) with 1/4 tsp of baking soda and 8 oz of water last night. I was attempting to enjoy some red wine and knew I would have a horrible night of reflux. I made the mix and drank it right before bed. It WORKS! No sour burps or acid burning it went away completely! I have slept with antacids, Pepto and pepcid by my bedside and none of it ever worked but this did! Thank you so much! I'm finally not afraid to eat and drink the things I love!
5384	91	6352	Dee from Fairfax, VA	2007-05-16 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I'd been having terrible heartburn for over a week. So bad that that my kids and husband were very worried. A few years ago I had six ulcers! But didn't want to start the standard gastro treatments lansoprazole or purple pills - I'm well aware of the downsides to them. My gastric problem was probably caused by my ADHD, I frequently forget to eat because I get so hyperfocused I don't notice I'm hungry!So, I went looking for a homeopathic cure and found your website. I read a whole bunch of stuff and probably confused one thing with another nevertheless this is what happened: I made the ACV mixture adding the Baking Soda also 2 tbsp Aloe juice; 1 tbsp of organic honey; 1 tbsp of'Coconut Oil (using warm water, which melts the honey and VCO). I tried with and without the VCO and for those who find the ACV drink unpalatable the VCO helps alot! The heartburn stopped in 24 hours! Major miracle. I felt focused, relaxed, energetic and pain free. The only side effect of note was/is gas. Is this from the VCO? Is there anything I can do about that? And is it OK to blend all this together? Should I be drinking it before or after or with a meal? I don't know about the other magical effects of VCO its only been 2 days! Thanks for this great site, its already helped me a lot!
5385	92	6353	4theluvofhoney from Orlando, Florida	2010-03-21 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	First of all, thank you to all the women who have shared their stories about BV. I've been dealing with BV now for 3 years. At first I thought I had hygeine issues and I was actually disgusted with myself! I used to douche every day. When I was diagnosed with BV about 1 year ago, I was given metronidozol, and ended up with a horrible yeast infection. I prefer to do things in a more holistic way, so I tried the acidophilis orally every day for a week. I also tried the hydrogen peroxide douche twice during that time. I did experience some relief. A couple days ago, though, I came across an article that mentioned using diluted honey with distilled water as a douche to treat vaginal yeast infections. I tried that 3 days ago, and again last night. I am so fresh and no discharge, no odor. I have found my treatment of choice for my BV. I used about 3tbsp in a standard size douche bottle, and filled the rest of the bottle with warm distilled water. Shake shake shake, insert, squeeze! The honey I purchased is 100% pure, uncooked, unfiltered. No oozing, no stickiness, or seepage after the douche either. Look up the benefits of honey for more info.
5386	92	6354	Pheonix  from Nsb, Florida	2011-04-14 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I too have been suffering from BV for about 2 years; everytime I'm diagnosed with it, my doctor prescribes me Flagyll and sends me on my way. The antibiotics helped for about 2 weeks, and then the discharge and malodor was back! I even changed my eating style because I was told it would help contain the problem, it did to a certain extent but not to my satisfaction. I found this website last night and after reading so many of the positive testimonials, I absolutely HAD to try this remedy. Needless to say IT WORKED! I havent felt this good down there in such a longgg time!
5387	92	6355	Monique from Richmond, Va	2011-03-31 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I've been suffering from BV for the past 2 years off and on. It has really been frustrating me! It started in 2009. The fishy ordor came first then the discharge. Ugh. I went to the doctor and I was diagnosed w/ BV. A couple months later it was back. Now for past 2 years its been coming back. The doctor keep perscribing the same 2 medications and obviously they are not working! I did some research on home remedys. I got tired of going 2 the doctors to just get prescribed the same meds that dont work! I was losing hope. I was letting this infection get me down! And my sex drive also went down. I couldnt let this infection control me and my sex life. I stumbled across 2 sites this site and another.org site and saw they did a study for hydrogen peroxide as a cure for BV. I saw the comments and how it worked for most other women. So I tried it(i dont like to try new things only if prescribed by DR. ).... IT WORKED! I AM SO HAPPY AND RELIEVED! I also use Pro B probiotic pills my doctor also recommended it. And its safe 2 say im CURED!!
5388	92	6356	Happilyrelieved from Columbus, Georgia	2010-10-11 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Even though there were so many posts on here about hydrogen peroxide working to relieve the odor, pain and itching, I was still a little skeptical. We are all brainwashed by Big Medicine, I think. And we trust doctors not to steer us wrong, so when they throw antibiotics at every problem, we just take it, without question and without exploring other options. But the hydrogen peroxide worked! It worked the first night, and my problem was completely fixed by the next day. I will, however, keep using it. Just for those who are wondering how to use it, I soaked a tampon with one part hydrogen peroxide and three parts water and wore it for a couple hours. That's it! Very simple! The best part: Doctors visit: Up to $150 Antibiotics: Nongeneric up to $50 Hydrogen peroxide: 52 cents Beating the system: Priceless
5389	92	6357	Adrian from Philadelphia, Pa, Usa	2010-09-26 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I was reading all the comments on how using 1 part water and 3 parts hydrogen peroxide might get rid of bacterial vaginosis and NO LIE trying it just ONCE instanly relieved the itching and burning. I will keep doing it once a day until I think it is gone but WOW did this work. Thanks sooo much!
5390	92	6358	Neena from Bloomfield, Ct	2010-09-02 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I am very pleased with the results of H2O2 for BV. I was skeptical but desperate because I am a soon to be bride and I do not want to present BV to my husband on honeymoon night. I tried H2O2 and it worked immediately. The next I checked frequently for odor... And there was none. Like others, months later there is still no odor or discomfort. I'm interested in what my PA (who prescribed $300 metronidazole) is going to say when I go back for my annual. My Testimony is true. I am no longer embarrassed or self-conscious with BV symptoms.
5445	92	6413	Athina from Fishkill, NY	2008-07-22 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I had a very slight case of BV for the first time in my life, but it did not go away with yogurt, probiotics, garlic, etc...I tried everything and I was just about ready to use vaginal metrogel, but decided to try this hydrogen peroxide. It worked!! No fishy odor whatsoever.I inserted about 30 cc's of hydrogen peroxide 3%- undiluted!!!! (I used a medication syringe- the kind used to give liquid medication to infants). lay on your back and keep your hips tilted up-allow the hydrogen do its work for about 4 minutes. Then sit on the toilet and allow it to drain out. It really worked well. And in case you are scared to put it up there- hydrogen peroxide is naturally occurring in the v-jay.
5391	92	6359	Rachel  from Sydney, Nsw, Australia	2010-05-25 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Thank you to everyone for all the information on dealing with BV. I had a Mirena IUD inserted just over a year ago and it took till very recently to get a diagnosis of BV to explain the persistent discharge and the smell. When the doctor handed me a prescription for Flagyll I decided to look for alternative treatments on the Internet and found this very helpful website. I tried swallowing cranberry tablets and acidophilus capsules, as well as inserting yoghurt, Acijel and Boric acid capsules. Nothing worked for very long. The Boric acid didn't work at all. Eventually I decided to try what so many people said worked for them: douching with H2O2. At first I used one part H2O2 to 3 parts bottled water in a sterilised syringe, once a day. After 4 days I moved on to two parts H2O2 to one part bottled water. The bubbling feeling inside was disconcerting but not too scary. It took over 7 days for it to work, but eventually the discharge and the smell vanished. I've been free of all symptoms for about 6 weeks and hope they won't return. Every morning I take a rounded teaspoon of Inulin and an acidophilus capsule just in case it helps maintain the balance of whatever bacteria I'm supposed to have. At least it can't hurt. Does anyone else take Inulin for this purpose?
5392	92	6360	Daniellal from New York, New York	2010-04-29 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I used hydrogen peroxide and it worked - yay! However - it is important to note that I dont have chronic BV, I just get it once in a while. It took about 12 days in total to clear up, and I changed my routine a little over the course of the 12 days. I started off with a 1 to 3 ratio of HP to water (regular tap water), and I used a squeeze bottle to squeeze it up my vaj. I did it right before bed. It stung like crazy, but it gave me relief for the night, but then by the next morning the itching was back. After 2-3 days I changed the dosage to a 1:4 ratio (slightly weaker), but then I started trying to hold it in for 5 minutes. After about 6-7 days of doing this it was definitely working and my symptoms were going away, but then they started to come back. So I started to hold it in for 15-20 minutes instead. This I did for about 4-5 days, and I think that's what cured it. I would recommend trying 1:3 ratio, if that stings too much then do a 1:4 ratio, but hold it in your vaj for 15 minutes minimum. Eventually I bought a 60-cc syringe from a medical supply store since the squeeze bottle was kind of annoying to use, and just blasted the HP right up into my vaj - I kept the syringe in place to block the liquid from pouring back out. I did feel a little silly laying on my back on a towel holding a syringe halfway in my vagina while a timer counted down 20 minutes, but hey, it worked. I think another key is to keep doing it for a day or two after your symptoms seem to be gone - sort of like antibiotics, where you feel better after a couple of days, but you are still supposed to keep taking them for the whole entire prescribed time. Good luck!
5393	92	6361	Anonymous from Ohio, USA	2010-04-15 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I would like to say thank you to earthlinc.com & all of the wonderful ladies who have shared their stories & remedies for BV..I have suffered from this since I was 18 years old. I am now going to be 28 in June..I couldn't see myself accepting this problem because for one, I am a super clean person & I was not going to keep taking Flaygel (if that's how you spell it) because it simply doesn't cure BV! I was browsing several different websites for home remedies that could possibly cure BV when I came across this site...THANK GOD FOR THAT! After reading one lady's remedy I immediately wrote everything down and went straight to the store. I brought the peroxide, got some disposable douche just so I could use the bottles, I got folic acid 800 mg vitamins as well as acidophilus with 1 billion active cultures..I got home and this is what I did: 1/2 cup luke warm water 1/2 cup hydrogen peroxide mixed the water & peroxide in my disposable douche bottle (make sure to empty the original douche mixture out and rinse out any remaining substance)
5394	92	6362	Wealthyheart from Northerncambria, Pa	2010-02-16 00:00:00	BETTER BUT NOT CURED	2	0	I used 1/5 3% hydrogen peroxide douche mixed with 1/5 distilled water. prepared another douche bottle with just distilled water. Sat in the tub, used the hp mix and waited 5 minutes then rinsed with the distilled water. I did all of this 2 times and then inserted a vaginal probotic right after. I did this 2 times in the morning and 2 times at night for 3 days. BV was gone but left me itching. I found a chart with symptoms of vaginal infections whiched helps me alot. Now I think I have a combination of yeast and Cytolytic Vaginosis. I'm using an ordinary 7 day yeast infection kit and I'm filling up a capsule full of Baking Soda and I am inserting the yeast cream in the morning for 7 days and inserting 1 Baking Soda capsual at night only 2 days a week for 2 weeks. I ended up with to much good bacteria i think and a yeast infection go figure. The Baking Soda will reduce some of the good bacteria.

5397	92	6365	Thankful from Toronto, Ontario	2009-12-27 00:00:00	BETTER BUT NOT CURED	2	0	Hi all... I came across this website a few months ago and I an so thankful I did! I've been suffering from BV for many years now and for me I get it everytime I have unprotected sex with an uncircumsised partner. I've had three partner that were not circumsised and have gotten BV repeatedly with all three but with others that were I have been fine. Anyhow.. my current partner is not circumsised and I have been using the 50% HP and 50% water douche and it has been working miracles... Is it safe to use it often? I've been using 1-3 times a week... any thoughts would be great
5398	92	6366	A from Chino, Ca	2009-12-02 00:00:00	SIDE EFFECTS	5	0	I just tried the tampon deal soaked in hydrogen peroxide 3%. I actually had to do it two times the first time I left the tampon in the plastick insert that you normally use to put the tampon in. Then I didn't feel any "bubbles" how everyone said so I thought it wasn't working or I didn't have BV. Then I tried again I soaked just the tampon in the hydrogen peroxide and then pushed it up there. I left it in for about 15 mins or so and I definately felt the bubbles this time. However when I took the tampon out it had blood on it and I am not on my period. I think that I may have a cyst again and maybe the hydrogen peroxide helped to open up the gland. (I get them in the glands that normally keep us wet or moist) So anyway I am hoping that maybe this could be the cure to that too. Otherwise I have no idea why their was blood on the bottom of the tampon. By the way I do not currently have any funky smell. Thank you for the assistance.
5446	92	6414	Beth from Edmonton, Canada	2008-07-13 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I tried the peroxide remedy for BV and it worked fabulous and almost instantly! One note though: don't forget that's it's a combo of peroxide and WATER!!! I did straight peroxide and what no one else mentioned is it burned like heck at first, but it must have worked because within 5 min. felt so much better....
5399	92	6367	Taylor M. from Lancaster, California, Usa	2009-11-23 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I started noticing a change in my body and a disgusting odor coming from down there, and it started getting worse over a course of a few days. I came to the conclusion it was BV. I started doing some research, and came upon this wonderful site (SOOOO thankful that I did!). I tried the tampon and 1/2 3% h2o2 and 1/2 water, soaked the tampon in the solution, and squeezed excess out, shoved it up there, left it in for about 2 hours, took it out and the smell was GONE!!! I couldn't believe it. I'm continuing to do this for atleast an hour a day, and am also taking 3 400mcg of Folic Acid daily, along with 100mg of b-6. Also, I heard that Apple Cider Vinegar works wonders for the body, so I made a little cocktail of 1 tbs of ACV and actual apple cider, you can't taste the vinegar at all!! I'm feeling very confident all these remedies will work. Hope this helped some of you! :)
5400	92	6368	Kajundiva504 from Irving, Tx	2009-11-16 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I would like to say first off, I SO LOVE THIS SITE!!!!!Now down to business. I too, suffer with BV. It is embarrasing because it just comes out of the blue. Today your fine and then the next day its like a fishy smell followed by this thick yet frothy discharge. I followed one persons suggestion with the tampon dipped in 3% hydrogen peroxide. I tried it and i'll be dangonit............it worked. I am a happy camper. Now i'll have to see how long it will last. Just to know I dont have to go the dr's office is great. No it didn't burn at all but i did feel it bubbling. Understand that each individual is different. As the 3% hydrogen peroxide dipped in the tampon worked for me, someone else a little more sensitive may have to add additional water to the peroxide.
5401	92	6369	Icantfly  from Somewhere In, Nj, USA	2009-11-12 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I started getting BV within a few months of seeing my now-fiance. For some reason I never got it before-- I have a feeling I'm allergic to semen because before him I never had vaginal contact with semen before. I thought he gave me an STI (I have trust issues), but then I found out from the gyno I had BV. She prescribed me antibiotics and that flagyl stuff (which tasted horrible). This didn't work--not even for a little while. The BV never went away. I started looking up cures and came upon this website.
5403	92	6371	Hislove from Chaska, Mn	2009-10-24 00:00:00	BETTER BUT NOT CURED	2	0	I'm 34 years old and didn't know that I had BV until last week. I knew something was wrong but didn't know it was BV until I finally said ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. I was done with wearing pantiliners every day of the month just so I didn't end up with wet pants in the store or something because I was leaking secretion and not pleasant smelling secretion. Musty, if you will. I was done with smelling like fish the minute my husband and I would "interact". I was done with the smell lingering for two days after. I was done with having to wait to have sex until my crotch was "decent enough" to get near. Done with the wetness and just generally done. I did the over the counter yeast infection test and saw that my ph level was higher then it should be. Read the paperwork that came with it and researched the "what it could be" things. Found this site and a couple of others (medical sites) and realized you all were saying all the same things I was. I'M NOT ALONE. Thank God. I felt that I was just generally less clean then everyone else. Everything short of shoving a scubber "up there" I was as clean as anyone else. I read about all the pills and food things and just felt overwhelmed. I then read about eating yogurt and the H202 douche and figured "I like eating yogurt but H202 in my woohoo? That's kinda scary cus I've seen how it bubbles and fizzes when I put earrings in it, do I really want that in me?" Answer: YES!!! Last night I was so desperate to just spend a "fun filled, worry free" evening with my husband that I grabbed a douche, emptied it, filled it half with H202 and half tap water. Jumped in the shower, did what I needed to do then filled it with tap water and did it again. Did the "finger test". Not great but not gone. So I thought "Screw it, I grabbed the bottle of H202, filled it 3/4 full and added a smidge of water (just to make me feel better about the chemicals inside me) and did what I needed to do. No second flush with water. LET THE ANGELS SING AND THE LIGT SHINE DOWN.... I DIDNT SMELL. NOT EVEN A LITTLE! My husband and I (warning: get explicit here) started the night with him "finger and taste testing" and he said "PERFECT". We went at it and NO SMELL NOTHING ZIP ZERO ZILCH. Even after... Even today... I almost cried last night when we were done and again this morning. First time in YEARS that I didn't dread it. Even as I sit here typing on my laptop, sitting pretzel style, NO SMELL!!!! I dont know if it will last, but I dont care. I'm 100% willing to buy H202 by the gallon if I need to and whenever I smell it coming on... I'm killing it. I am also adding 2 yogurts a day to my diet to help keep it at bay and I also found AZO. A vitamin thing to help regulate the ph levels. One pill a day was more simple to me then a full round of all the other stuff that was mentioned and a lot cheaper. In short (I know it's too late for that (o: ) but don't be afraid, just give it a try. There is no "cure" for BV but there is a way to heal the symptoms. Try different things until you find what works for you. For me, I am IN LOVE with H202! If you have any questions what-so-ever, please get a hold of me, I am more then willing to help in any way I can. Sometimes, just knowing you're no the only one is a HUGE relief. I will keep you all posted as my symptoms do what they do! "Oh honey... kick the kids out... mama wants to take advantage of our new found freedom" (wink)

5405	92	6373	Greenissexy from Bluegrass, Ky	2009-10-15 00:00:00	BETTER BUT NOT CURED	2	0	Hydrogen Peroxide Douche cured my Bacterial Vaginosis! Sunday, I started having this fishy odor for the first time in my entire life. I am in my mid-20s. Before then, I had never douched nor had any feminine problems down there. I'm thinking this odor came from stress, eating poorly that week, and drinking too much alcohol that weekend, plus I tried a hard liquor that I've never had before. I was thinking about setting up an appointment with a gynocologist but decided to do some online research after "self-diagnosing" myself with BV. I came across this site and decided to give it a try. So yesterday (Wednesday), for the first time in my life, I douched. My mother had this a summer's eve douche in the bathroom. I took one of those unused bottles, unwraped it, emptied out the solution that was already in it, then rinsed it out, then filled the douche bottle 1/2 with Hydrogen Peroxide and 1/2 with spring water, shook it up, got in the shower, inserted it and squeezed the solution up in there, held the solution inside for 2-3 minutes, then released it out in the shower. Then I did a douche rinse with water. Today (Thursday), I have no odor and no discharge AT ALL!!! I never thought I would be sharing something like this! Hope this encourages someone that is suffering from this odor for a short period of time. I also did a mouthwash and gargle with Hydrogen peroxide and had fresher breath too!
5406	92	6374	Lady Bv Free from Vb, Va	2009-09-17 00:00:00	BETTER BUT NOT CURED	2	0	I have suffered from BV forever! Have sex, have period, boom, have BV. I have had to wear pantyliners for YEARS! Everything was tried by the Doc...forget them! I used 3% Hydrogen peroxide, do not dilute. It is already diluted to 3% with buffered water. I douched once and the odor decreased, went to dinner for 2 hrs, then douched before bed with same full strength solution. I had a lil itch and tingle that was not originally there for about 15 mins, then gone. Everything gone. No odor, no discharge, no itch, no redness, no pantyliner, NO EMBARRASSMENT!!! I plan to continue the hydrogen peroxide for 7 days, then start life again. I am soooo very happy I found this site and thank all the women for their testimonies. I am taking a 800 mcg folic acid pill and probiotic daily already for intestinal issues and will continue. But the addition of the 3% Hydrogen Peroxide has been the glory help I have been looking for! I just texted my main squeeze who has had to be on the side lines in bed due to this BV and requested we test the results soon with some great sex(this is what usually induces an attack). I will keep you posted of the future results for I know readers need to know if there is a long-term help, not just a quick partial fix. Good luck to all!
5407	92	6375	Aliasnan from Dallas, Tx	2009-09-17 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	OK ladies, I have read countless fourums on BV trying to find home reamedies. I started having that dreadful fishy odor with LOTS of white cheesey gunk....... the odor only got worse, to the point to where it smelled like reeking dead fish. I never have an unuasual odor, most of the time I am odorless, with occaisonal sweet or normal odor from excercise or arrousal. I shower twice a day, I use a mild soap like baby wash or dove on my vuvla and labia, then just squirt the shower water up as a water douche. This method works great for me and I never had any problems. Anyway, I started having the BV symptoms last Saturday. I tried the salt sitz bath, the vinegar douche, and tea tree oil, although they cut the odor down, it was still there. I also tried the plain yogurt on a tampon overnight, it did cut the odor down but not fully. My instinct was to use peroxide, and so I researched that and found a clinical study where 80% or so of the patients were cured with peroxide. This is what I did: Yesterday, I soaked a tampon in 3% hydrogen peroxide, full stregnth. It made the tampon swell, and it was kinda hard but I had to just shove it up there. I left it in about 30 minutes. Then I did the finger smell test. Wow!!! Only a faint smell of fish. Then, I used a douche of 1/4 perioxide, and 3/4 water. I was always told to never douche with anything but plain water .....I had several GYNS and midwifes say if I feel the need to douche, plain water is always fine, which is why I just use the shower head. Then, I filled a syringe without the needle with straight peroxide, and flushed it up there, twice. The past two nights I've used the yougurt on a tampon, it seems to help also. As of today, there is NO fishy odor, no odor at all! I will use the perioxide tampon method (because douching scares me) for today and tommorow, then maybe once a week for a month to make sure this is really gone. I'll also go ahead and use the yogurt overnight for at least tonight.....it did seem to help. So thats it ladies!! This is how it worked for me ........the yogurt drastically reduced odor over night, and the perioxide cut it out instantly. Good luck , I'll post more if this comes back. I heard alot of good things about ____, and its just so expensive, I hope I don't have to use it. But I'll say this, I will keep some on hand for after intimate moments or cycles so that the PH NEVER gets so thrown off again!!! What a horrendous, embarrasing infection!!!! (I'm pretty sure mine came from semen; after my boyfriend ejaculated inside me for the first time, I was having symptoms that night-if that ever happens again-afterwards I guess it will be time to "refresh".)

I started using it about 2 weeks ago. I douched with 3/4 h202 and 1/4 h20 for 4 nights and h202 only for 3 nights. To date, the discharge is so much less than before and the foul odor is gone. Even after sex with there is no fishy odor. I do plan to continue this method at least once a month and sometimes douche after sex. So happy that I came across this site.

5413	92	6381	Eyeshado from Florida	2009-06-06 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Hi, I too had BV and could not get rid of it...until I did some research and found this site, boy was I happy to know I wasn't the only one in the world with this awful problem. After reading so many of the entries, I tried it that same night!! I remember I had a bran new bottle of Hygrogen peroxide in my cabinet,So I went and got a syringe ( the kind you would use to put medicine into; for a yeast infection) Its the only thing I had on hand and I was desperate. So I did the half and half (water with peroxide) I use the needleless syringe to insert it up my vajayjay, and I repeated it about 3 times, then I used the pure peroxide (3%) and washed in the outside. That was about 3 weeks ago and the smell was gone instantly!!! and has not come back as of yet. I'm soo happy and women do not hesitate on trying it cause it does work!!!! You will feel fresh fully clean!!!! You have nothing to lose but the SMELL!!! : )
5414	92	6382	Not Telling from Longmont, CO	2009-05-27 00:00:00	SIDE EFFECTS	5	0	Warning about hydrogen peroxide douche. I was douching with one third peroxide, 2 thirds water almost every day after sex to stop the bv and it gave me a really bad UTI. I spent thousands at the urologist trying to figure out why i was peeing blood. After having a scope of my bladder an infection was found and I was on antibiotics for 3 months. After that I made my boyfriend wear a condom which stopped the bv. I noticed his saliva also caused it. I think some people just have the creepy crud and my body couldn't handle it.
5415	92	6383	Lainie from Madison, WI	2009-05-27 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	A Note about H2O2 and BV: Just to clarify...I noticed several ladies worried about douching with Hydrogen Peroxide and calling it "bleach". This is incorrect! Yes, peroxide can have a bleaching (i.e. removing color) effect but it is NOT the same as the agent used on hair for color stripping. IN fact, your vagina makes a version of hydrogen peroxide. If you read the bottle you should see it is used as a gargle...if you can put it in your mouth rest assured you can put it in your hoo-hoo! Hydrogen Peroxide helps to balance the vaginal PH, and imbalance is what causes yeast and BV infections. If the PH swings too far one way the you get a yeast infection if it goes the other way then it is BV.

And I was tired of the antibiotics from the drs. I looked up home remedies for bv and found this site. Once I read the post I was a little scared but I figured it could not be any worse then the he'll I was in. So I used the hydrogen peroxide last week. I filled half of the douche bottle with warm water and the other half with the peroxide. It burned a little at first but i took a cool wash cloth and placed it on my vagina until it stopped and there has been no odor no any discharge since. This site is very helpful !!!!!!

5420	92	6388	Toni from San Antonio, TX	2009-03-18 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Hydrogen Peroxide is perfect for curing BV! I had BV once a few years ago and was given an antibiotic for it. It did the job. I had the same symptoms last month (strong rotton fish odor), so I knew it was BV. After a urinalysis and culture sample, my doctor actually told me there was nothing wrong, but gave me the antibiotics anyway. It cleared my symptoms. Within a month, I noticed a slight change in my vaginal smell, so I knew the BV was back. I didn't want to wait until the smell overpowered me again, but I didn't want to take any more antibiotics. They're not really good for you as they kill ALL bacteria, even the good ones. I did a search online for natural cures and found this web site. I saw that the Hydrogen Peroxide cure is all over the internet, and since I always have some handy, I tried it right away. I measured 30 ml of non-diluted H2O2 in a turkey baster. With a towel under me, I lay down with my legs over my head and, using a mirror, squeezed the H202 into my relaxed vagina. (I did not insert the baster. It's much simpler to squeeze it in from the outside.) Stay relaxed or you will push the liquid out. I waited 5 minutes before releasing the H2O2 into the toilet. I did this once a day for 7 days. After the first treatment, the smell was negligible. After the second treatment, the smell was completely gone. It did the H2O2 reaction did fizz a little, but did not burn or feel uncomfortable. Cheap, easy, immediate, effective, natural, and private. Try it.
5421	92	6389	Erica from Toronto, Ontario, Canada	2009-03-05 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	For anyone who doubts if hydrogen peroxide cures BV, it really, really does, don't hesitate to try it. I had BV for months and tried all sorts of expensive antibiotics which only worked temporarily, and the infection would return after a few days. My doctor even prescribed flagylstatin which was horribly expensive and only worked for about 7 days. When I complained about the recurring infection, all the the doctor could suggest was that i get another prescription for antibiotics!! I found the information about hydrogen peroxide from this website, and other sites. I bought a reusable douche kit from the drugstore and douched with the half hydrogen peroxide, half water solution for 7 days and my BV cleared up completely. It has been 3 months, and there have been no symptoms whatsoever. The one thing I noticed was the symptoms did not improve until I started douching deep in the vagina (about 3 inches). The shallow douching (1 inch or so) did not work for me. I am also continuing with folic acid. God bless everyone that put the information about this miraculous and INEXPENSIVE cure on this website.
5422	92	6390	Carrissa from Appleton, WI	2009-02-17 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Hello! I read this site six months ago and decided to try the one part hydrogen peroxide and one part water douche for my reoccuring (i.e. every month or two) BV and yeast infections. I douche with this mix everytime after my husband and I are intimate and I can say that I have been BV and yeast infection free for all six months!! It is absolutely amazing. I had done a lot of research on possible causes and found that PH was a big factor. I also read that our bodies produce hydrogen peroxide naturally so I was less nervous about trying it. My infections started after my husband I got married (I was a virgin before). I had also read that semen is very alkaline. I figured that he was very alkaline and my body was not able to regulate my PH on its own. All my research took a long time between treatments at the doc (metronidozole, etc.) and OTC treatments. One time, a year and a half ago, I douched with only 30 ml of hydrogen peroxide after we were intimate and I was infection free for several months. I then decided to do this every other time we were intimate and my infections came back. For some reason I didn't attribute the reoccurrence to my not using the hydrogen peroxide everytime and did another round of doc visits and terrible medicines that only worked for a few weeks. Then I came back here and read someone's idea of doing the half water half hydrogen peroxide and decided to try doing it after sex everytime. It has worked! For anyone suffering from BV and/or yeast infections - I recommend doing this! I buy the disposable douches from the store, like summer's eve (they already have some mix in them but I dump it out and just use the bottle for a few weeks, being very careful to keep it clean), make my half water half H202 mix and rinse after sex and that's that! Sometimes it burns a bit but then I just hold a warm wash cloth to the area and the burning goes away in a couple mins. I hope this helps some people because no one should have to live with these infections!
5423	92	6391	Brittany from Hitchcock, Tx	2009-01-22 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I'm a seventeen year old mother of one and i've been suffering from bv for almost two years, it's hell! i like most have visited the doctor for this many times and all i got out of it was a yucky cream or pill that was actually a yeast infection medication. a couple of weeks ago i went to the clinic and the nurse told me that i might have been suffering from bv and gave me diflacan, of course it didn't work. i decided to do a little research on bv and i came across this site, i saw that many women tried hydrogen peroxide (h202) in a douche and they had great reviews on it. i went to the local drug store last night and got the peroxide and douche, i poured 30cc's of peroxide into the douche and tried it when i took a shower. i did this three times and washed my vagina with (summer's eve feminine body wash for sensitive skin) when i woke up this morning the oh so familiar odor and discharge were completely gone! the discharge has come back slightly but i intend on douching regularly with peroxide for the next seven days. i hope this works for you!
5424	92	6392	Lisa from Sudbury, Ontario Canada	2009-01-18 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have dealt with BV for years. After medication from the doctors that never really worked I started to do research on it. I found a site from a Midwife - www.gentlebirth.org/archieves/vagInfections.html#Vaginosis . I decided to try the following hydrogen peroxide wash. Directions for hydrogen peroxide washes: Take a 30 cc syringe (without the needle) place 3 cc of hydrogen peroxide and fill the rest with distilled water. Insert the syringe in the vagina about an inch and push the fluid in. Do this once a day for seven days. During treatment period the partner should wear condoms during intercourse. To prevent recurrences the partner should wash after intercourse with a mild antibacterial soap (like dial). I also had my husband wash with this every day for seven days even if there was no intercourse. The only thing different I did was in addition to the above I got a perineal care bottle and put 1 to 2 oz of peroxide then I filled the rest of it with warm water, shake it to make sure it is mixed well then I would wash my genital area every time I went to the bath room, this seemed to help with the itching. I have only had one reoccurance with BV in three years and I did the above and it has not come back. I know this worked well for me but some people do respond differently to things. Hope it works.
5425	92	6393	Terri from Boone, NC	2009-01-15 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Wow I went out yesterday and bought hydrogen peroxide 3% mixed 1/2 and 1/2 with H2o and it worked as far as the odor! I then soaked a tampon with orgainc plain yogurt and pressed organic garlic and inserted for an hour. This morning I smell a bit of garlic but I am going to do another douche with the peroxide now. How long do I continue to douche? Will this effect my bladder and UT at all because I have been prone to bladder infections in the past this is why I have been on probiotics for 2 years straight everyday. Also does my sex partner need to do anything to prevent re infection? I was going to have him rinse with the solution before sex.
5426	92	6394	Grosbois from Gainesville, Florida	2008-12-28 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I was searching the internet earlier and came accross the use of hydrogene peroxide for bv. I mixed equal amount of the above and water then squirted the liquid into my vagina laying down in the shower for a couple of min.one hour later I checked with a mirror and the discharge was totally GONE . This is just after one time before bed . I am going to do this for at least 4 days 2 make sure that it works because there is a slight fishy odor still.tomorrow I will buy folic acid because at this point I am desperate. we can always camouflage a discharge but certainly not a fishy smell so I really hope all this works.

I got on line an tried to find the most sensible home remedy. PEROXIDE> i decided to try it and ladies it really worked thus far. Yea there was a slight burning,itching sensation after wich completely stopped. i used a douch bottle filled half with peroxide and other half with warm water. held it inside for about 20-30 seconds and gave a real push. this morning, nothing, no smell, no discharge, nothing I am very pleased to say you too should try it. good luck.

I tried it as recommended (1 tsp in 4 oz of water) and it was soooooo hot I nearly gagged! I diluted it about 10 fold and managed to gargle it but it made me cough so much I actually threw up once!

5427	92	6395	Rachel from Montclair, NJ	2008-12-21 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	This summer I was the unlucky host of a bacterial vaginosis episode. I wasn't sure if it was a yeast infection or bacterial since my symptoms were applicable to both (I had discharge that was initially clumpy and then more like runny egg white that would occur every month after my period and subside shortly before my next cycle. Also had slight itch but nothing unbearable.) I went to my gyneo (a midwife) and had a culture taken. BV was the diagnosis and I was given a prescription for clindesse (one application treatment of vaginal cream.) The first horror was the price I paid for the clindesse at the pharmacy. $70 out of my pocket WITH INSURANCE! Second horror, the itch from hell that I experienced as a side effect of the clindesse. The itch started about 3 days after using the clindesse and did not let up for one week straight. I tried everything to get the itch to stop but nothing really helped. I was miserable, angry and desperate to get rid of the itch that was not only external (outer labia) but internal as well. This was truly the itch you cannot scratch!! I had to wait until my body expelled all of the clindesse before I finally got some real relief from the itch (clindesse is a waxy, creamy substance that is inserted vaginally, kind of like a chap stick.) After the bout with the clindesse and following my next period I had more persistent discharge that was like thick egg whites. I was very frustrated at this point. I read nearly all of the posts on earthclinic about cures for BV and decided to try douching with straight 3 percent hydrogen peroxide. I did this for 3 days in a row and the discharge stopped. I have had two periods since using the peroxide douche and have not had any abnormal discharge. I consider myself to be free of BV!!! If any of the symptoms come back, I will certainly use the peroxide douche again.
5428	92	6396	Melanie from Toronto, ON, CA	2008-12-20 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	i had a baby 6 months ago, and after that i guess that changed my vaginal flora. i didn't even know what all the discharge was until maybe 2 months ago. there was no itching, just the discharge and a fishy smell (most of the time it was pretty faint) i thought all of it was related to postpartum. anyway i was sick of wearing liners every day!! i researched it, and found out it was BV. i've never had bv in my life!! i decided to cure it naturally before going to my dr, and that's when i found earthclinic!! first i tried garlic pills to no avail. then, i tried acidophilus (2 billion) for a couple of weeks with the yogurt tampons. still did not work. then i tried the hydrogen peroxide solution douche(1/2 water, 1/2 h202). it only provided temporary relief... like a few hours. i decided to take the folic acid as well (1000mcg once perday). i didn't see any change, and was hugely disappointed since these remedies have worked for so many ppl. i was on and off the acidophilus and folic acid, but i maintained the h202 regime (douche every 1.5 days). well, it has PAID OFF!!! 2.5 weeks after i tried the douche and pills it WORKED!!! i don't need to wear a liner and i am smell free (for the past 3 days)!!! i improved very gradual at first, but then all of a sudden all the discharge disappeared!!

I knew they thought I was crazy I have been having this discharge (white milky) no odor just excessive discharge I couldn't tell u the last time I had sex, I mean this at the time was really taken over my life, trust me when I say I tried EVERYTHING the only thing that seemed to work (now keep in mind out of everything I tried clindess spelling I know is wrong cleared up my discharge for only a day) HYDROGEN PEROXIDE WORKS I started using it yesterday morning I douche 1/2 peroxide 1/2 water it didn't burn that much just felt bubbly down there did not see a discharge all day was waiting for this morning that's when I have the most this morning I had a tad bit totally nothing compared to what it use to be, being that I have had this problem for almost 2 years so I figure its going to take more than 1 douche to get my flora back in order so I douche again today and took 1 fem dophilus pill but one thing I don't want to over do it with the peroxide how many times should I douche the or everyone is different but one thing I can say I feel like im on the road to some great healing.

5431	92	6399	Maleasha from Baltimore, MD	2008-11-24 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Peroxide worked for my BV odor. I came across this website after researching for many months on natural cures for BV. I knew I had it for about a month and went to the doc to get some relief. Surprisingly, they told me my test came back fine and that I was probably just having normal irritation. I couldn't believe it even after I told them of the foul odor that comes back a little while after showering. So on the hunt for my own cure I found you guys. I haven't had a chance to pick up the folic acid yet, but I wanted to try the peroxide out of curiousity. I mixed 1/4 cup of water with an equal amount of perioxde and then used a baby medicine dropper(was all I had) as a mini douche. As soon as I did it the first time it started to foam up which made me know infection was present. Well after I finished it all I waited. I instantly felt more fresh and 1hr, 2hrs, 3hrs later I was still fresh and no discharge. I couldn't believe it!!! It seemed to reappear later the next day slightly, but I think it was because I hadn't started the folic acid yet. Had slight burning feeling with the first douche but after a few seconds it wore off and I was fine. But ladies, yes...this stuff really works! thank you!
5432	92	6400	CJ from Northville, MI	2008-11-22 00:00:00	WORKED TEMPORARILY	3	0	Ok...I have the same story as most of you (recurrent BV that meds only help temporarily) blah blah blah. Anyway, I found this website and the Hydrogen peroxide douche and it a miracle. Completely took all symptoms away immedietly. I was so relieved. But then, just like with everything else, the BV would come back. Usually after a few weeks. I would then use the douche again (always for 7 days) and it would go away again. Ive been doing this for a few months. I noticed that a lot of times the BV seems to come back after my period. I then use the douche and its gone again for a few weeks. Now, however, the douche doesnt seem to be working as well. It will take away the smell but not the discharge and only for maybe a day. I am not through the 7 days yet so we'll see...
5435	92	6403	Arlana from Taylorville, IL	2008-08-28 00:00:00	SIDE EFFECTS	5	0	Hi, I am ACH, I think I have BV from the sounds of it...YEP! I have been fighting this for a month now and I have been on flagyl, metro gel, clindesse, bactrim, diflucan, all of it. I read your comments and tried the hydrogen peroxide douche for about 3 days and I am as red as a lobster on the external part of my vagina...is that normal? Should I continue the hydrogen peroxide or stop, I read where a lady used iodine and water douche and I am just about ready to give up. The odor is still there but the discharge is gone, I don't know if it is because I am on so many meds right now that my body doesn't know if its healed or to produce more yeast...PLEASE HELP! Got any suggestions??
5436	92	6404	Danielle from Northeast, IN	2008-08-14 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I'm 30 yrs old. After a few weeks with a new sexual partner, I got my first case of BV. I was put on antibiotics for strep throat around the same time, and was hoping those would clear the BV as well. It got worse. The smell was awful, and nothing was helping. Never having BV or any STDs before, I was freaked out. After finding this site during an internet search, I decided to try the 1/2 hydrogen peroxide 1/2 water douche, along with acidophillus and folic acid supplements twice daily. I'm not sure how much the vitamins helped, but the H202/water douche eliminated my BV immediately. I was very nervous about using peroxide as a douche, but I'm so glad I tried it. The BV was literally gone completely by the next morning, without even a hint that there was a problem just hours earlier. THANK YOU SO MUCH! After being very discouraged by reading all the gyno prescribed treatments that do not work for people, this simple remedy was a Godsend. Thanks again to all the women who left comments about their positive experience. You encouraged me to try it, and it worked 100%.
5437	92	6405	E from New York, NY	2008-08-12 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Well ladies, I'm here to testify about my experience using hydrogen peroxide to end BV and a yeast infection. My story: I became sexually active about a year ago. I began to have yeast infections and BV about a month after I became sexually active. Month after month, I went to the doctor and was prescribed flagly, gyconozole, and diflucan. These medications kept my infections at bay for about a month before they returned in full force. The medications affects began to wear off and I was getting the infections every two weeks. I began researching on my own, as it was painfully clear that the medications I was using did not have any valuable long term effects. I read several websites like this and studies that suggested that Peroxide, of all things, was a viable remedy for vaginal infections. I was always weary of douching, as the modern science community recommends avoiding docuhing. Desperate and tired of going back and forth to the doctor, I used peroxide after my last infection. I mixed 3 tablespoons of 3% peroxide with 3 tablespoons of tap water into a small travel douche while in the shower. I then laid in the tub and inserted the mixture. I laid on the floor of the tub for about 2 minutes to allow the peroxide to foam up. When I stood up, I pushed the mixture out and the peroxide came out foamy. The peroxide COMPLETELY cleared up my infections (both yeast and BV). I used it for 5 days in a row. I don't know how often I have to douche to stop the infections from coming back. I do know that I feel much better using peroxide rather than these ridiculous prescriptions given to me by my doctor. Contrary to the medications, peroxide promotes the growth of healthy bacteria in your vagina. The medication destroys everything in your vagina, particularly antibiotics. This has serious consquences on your vagina's ability to rebalance itself. Peroxide is a much better alternative to not only killing harmful bacteria and yeast in the vagina, but it also helps the vagina rebalance itself. Lack of balance is the root of the problem anyways. It is the lack of balance that allows bad bacteria and yeast to grow out of control. In addition to douching with peroxide whenever I feel an infection coming on, I also take a probiotic and a multivitamin with 600mg of folic acid. Good luck ladies, E

HOPE U HAVE AS GOOD OF LUCK AS I HAVE.
5439	92	6407	Jessica from Hartselle, Alabama	2008-08-09 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I tried your recommendation to use hydrogen peroxide for bacterial vaginosis and it worked INSTANTLY! I felt relief right away. Just a few hours later I felt totally normal. I followed the suggestion of one of the commenters on this site and made a mixture in a shot glass of 1/2 hydrogen peroxide and 1/2 water, then used a bulb syringe to apply the mixture inside and outside. I did this 3 times (3 shot glasses). What a cheap remedy! I LOVE your site for giving this suggestion. Thank you soooo much.
5440	92	6408	Traci from Orlando, FL	2008-08-08 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Finally cured of BV. It took some fine tuning but I found what works for me. I take a shot glass and fill it half with hydrogen peroxide and half with water. I then take a bulb syringe (like the one to clean your ear of wax) and suction the mixture. I use this as a "mini douche" but be careful to squeeze the air out before inserting. The bulb syringe also doubles as a "mini portable bidet" fill it with water and/or hydrogen peroxide and squirt on your genitalia to clean after urinating or a bowel movement. Hope it helps others it works wonders for me and the syringe is easy to take along on trips.
5441	92	6409	Joanna from Paramus, NJ	2008-08-03 00:00:00	BETTER BUT NOT CURED	2	0	Wow! This site is amazing. I've been telling my doctor for years that I felt like something was off but after treating me over and over for a yeast infection he told me this is just my body. I swore it was something else and finally decided to take it upon myself to find out. I've obviously had bv for god only knows how long. It has to be at least 10 years though. It's been the worst thing to deal with. I was constantly changing and washing. I read all your posts and began the peroxide with water. It did get rid of the smell almost immediately. I've been doing douches every day in the shower for about a week. I'm nervous to stop and have that smell come back. The one thing that hasn't been kicked is the whitish discharge. It's nowhere near as bad but I notice that in the morning it's back. Is there something that I'm not doing that I should be???? Any guidance would be extremely appreciated. I don't know if I should be douching more. I'm not taking the folic acid but am taking the priobiotic acidophilus.... one a day. Maybe I should up that dosage. I don't know I just want to live a normal life. Thank you for everything!!! In my case, this site has been able to help a situation where my doctor had no idea.
5442	92	6410	Aniya from Richmond, Virginia	2008-07-26 00:00:00	WORKED TEMPORARILY	3	0	Have had problems with bv for over 10 years and im only 24! have gotten medicine several times but didnt really help. i have just discharge and not smell or any pain. i have tryed peroxide but it only helped for a couple hours. i recently went back 2 my doctor and was told that my discharge is normal but that i lack all the normal bacteria that is present in the vagina. does anyone have any suggestions how i can restore the balance and return all the bacteria that should be present. im guessing because all bacteria is not present that that could be the reason why i have the discharge and not the smelling or the pain.

I use a 50/50 dilution with water.Works great. My husband read how impure 3% over the counter is and ordered food grade. He diluted it down to 3% for me. Well, I don't know what happened, I imagine his numbers were off....but I was severely burned and immediately washed with pure water. This was two days ago, the pain and rawness is subsiding, but I am suffering. NEVER use the food grade again. Does anyone have any suggestions for the burn.

5447	92	6415	Raydiant from Syracuse , New York	2008-07-09 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have sufferd with BV for at least 1 1/2 years. I have constanly been to the doctor only to receive treatment with antibiotics. I am soooooooo thankful to all the people who took their time to write to this forum with their natural cures. I happened to try the Acidophilus pills 2 a day not sure of the mg because I don't have the bottle. I took them for about 3-4 days and saw a slight difference in the oder but not anything significant. I went out this morning and purchased the Folic Acid 400mcg, I took 2 today, and inserted a tampon with Hydrodgen Peroxide Solution this morning. This afternoon and I believe that it was mainly the HYDRODGEN PEROXIDE THAT CURED ME OF THAT AWFUL SMELL. It cost me $3.88 at Walmart for the tampons with the plastic applicator or a douche back will due, and $.50 for the peroxide. I recommend EVERYONE try the Peroxide FIRST!!!!!!!!!! I am going to continue with everything, I even take a multivitamin which everyone should do whether you have BV or not. With much love for my Sisters & And many thanks to the women who also had the courage to post their stories. I am only on day 1 with the Peroxide I will repost in about a week or 2 to let everyone know if it's long term.
5448	92	6416	Enigma from Encino, California	2008-06-30 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I know what caused my BV, several long Jacuzzi sessions, a long bath with fragrance, hot weather, and wearing swimsuits because the synthetic traps the bacteria and sweat. Yesterday I poured HP in a bowl and absorbed it with a medium sized tampon and pushed it inside. Relief from the get go.... Am repeating this today, along with going shopping for some Acidophilus, Folic Acid, and plenty of plain yogart. I'll also get some 100% cranberry juice. No sugar, no underwear, and no soap, unless it's natural soap that I get at the Trader Joes. I'll scoop out the discharge collecting during each shower. This has helped so much in the past with keeping the bacteria and yeast to a minimum. Good luck people!
5449	92	6417	Amy from Somewhere in, Oklahoma	2008-06-25 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I am SO thankful I found this website! I'm 25 & I've been plagued with BV off & on for the past 3 years. The antibiotics quit working on me. I didn't know what to do, I was so embarrassed! I had a very strong odor that I could smell through my clothes, so I knew other people could smell me as well! I decided to look for natural remedies yesterday & came across this website. I read all of the remedies. The only one I had on hand was hydrogen peroxide. I didn't have a douche, so I just poured some peroxide into a tampon. I left it in for 30-45 minutes. For good measure, I also wiped my privates with the peroxide. The smell went away immediately. When I was getting ready for bed last night, I took off my underwear & there wasn't any discharge either! I feel like a new woman! I also ordered some Acidophilus & Folic Acid to take to keep the BV in check. Vitamins.com has a sale right now. I paid a total of $17, & that'll last me around 6 months! That's a hell of a lot cheaper than those awful antibiotics that don't even cure the problem! THANK YOU EARTH CLINIC & all the women who have shared their stories!!!
5450	92	6418	Kasey-Clay from Orlando, FL	2008-06-12 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Hello All, kasey-Clay in the the house on a serious note. I like many other on this site have been trying to fight the battle of BV. I had gone to my doctor so much to seek treatment that he thought i was a little strange, but i was like why can't you help me and why do you think i'm crazy??? I heard that i might need to change my diet, but being 35 and 115 pounds. I take very good care of myself but change my diet as i was not willing to take the chance of loosing any weight. Last week I came across this site and heard about the hydogen perixode I thought if the label say to use as a mouth wash what else could you use it for. So Sunday night began my quest to see if i would have any luck as the other women here on the site. The first time using the the perixode (which i used 1/2 perioxd and rest water)i felt super clean and didn't have any discharge for the whole day.While i still had odor the discharge was not there. it's thursday now and i can say the the odor as well as the discharge is gone. I will have to post back after my complete seven days and let everyone know how i am doing without doing the treatment. I figure i may have to do follow up treatments as my boby PH is slightly high and i'm unwilling to change my diet, but if that's all i have to do and no more trips to the doctor for BV I feel like i have my life back and i'm very thankful to everyone who has shared there story. This is a hard subject to address because we all want to feel and look our best inside and out!! I'll keep everyone posted as to how i'm doing next week.
5451	92	6419	Barbara from Tampa, FL	2008-06-09 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I would definitely say that this is a miracle cure!! I have suffered with BV for about 2 years. I did the whole doctor visit and the $50 prescription that DID NOT work. I finally decided to do some searching on my own and stumbled across this site. Soon as I read all the comments I went straight out and bought the hydrogen peroxide and the probiotics. I did the peroxide douche as soon as I got home, and then right before I went to bed. The next day there was barely any discharge and the smell was gone. I did the douche once more that evening and I am cured!! No discharge or smell! I am so relieved that I found this site. I feel so much better about myself and am glad that I am over this awful dilema.

It was amazing I have used everything from antibotics to every remedy in the world but this one was different. At one point I didn't think it was working it stung while inserting it but it was worth it.I am currently still using it to clear up my bv and taking the acid folic peels. This is just so amazing God was the only one who heard my cry and you all were the angels who helped me fing the cure to stop my crying.I thank you all.

Let me tell you, I am amazed at the difference the Perioxide douche made as soon as I used it. Instantly the order and discharge is gone. I am so amazed that I keep running to the bathroom using the mirror to look at see if maybe the discharge is there but NOTHING!!! I just took the folic acid and probiotic this evening so i will keep you posted. It saddens me that no one told me this years ago. I was told that my body doenst produce enough good bacteria but nothing was ever said about the benefits of perioxide or even supplements to introduce healthy bacteria back into my body. This site is great. I am so thankful that I found it.
5454	92	6422	Dawn from Memphis, TN	2008-04-18 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I went back to the doctor for the second time in a month yesterday for BV. I was first on a regimen of three different prescriptions (oral) and then yesterday was prescribed a $60 cream in hopes that would "fix me." I came home without purchasing the cream and started researching online. I sent my husband out immediately after finding this site. I did a rinse of H2O2 while he was gone to get a douche bag and could already tell a difference when he got out. I used the H2O2 and H2O solution and wow!! I felt better, smelt better and I'm hooked!! Thank you, thank you , thank you!! Today I will get the folic acid and probiotics from a reputable supplement store.
5455	92	6423	Cara from Thousand Oaks, CA	2008-04-07 00:00:00	BETTER BUT NOT CURED	2	0	Hydrogen Peroxide douche relieved the symptoms of persistent Bacterial Vaginosis! I'm a registered nurse who is properly informed about all the different kinds of medicine available to treat BV. However,None of the medicine I took worked for my BV. I was diagnosed with BV after taking a strong antibiotic I took for bronchitis last year(In Nov 07). Since then, I have been suffering from persistent BV that won't go away with oral Flagyl, Doxycline, Clindamycin vaginal cream, Tindamex and finally Metrogel. My vaginal culture was normal because pathogenic anarobic bacteria normally lives in the vagina. I didn't have that much of discharge or fishy odor at all. My main symptoms were buring and swelling of my vagina. I was so frustrated that none of those drugs I took cure my BV. I have never had anything like this in my life! I stop having sex with my husband for months! I simply did not have desire to have sex because my bottom was hurting. My Gyn really did not know what to do anymore. Since, I'm a clinical nurse, I actually knew more about it that she was. I finally read this web-site and decided to try Hydrogen Peroxide douche method. I take multivitamin that has folic acid but to be honest, it is the Vitamin C that helps with BV than the folic acid. I douched with half HP and water for the first three days. I began to see some relief. Then I started my period. After my period, the symptoms came back again. I started the HP therapy again. This time, I used 30cc syringe filled with straight 3% HP rather than mixing with water for 7 days. I gradually started to feel better. So far, I don't think it is 100% cured yet but I have high hope that HP douche will restore the PH balance. I'll keep you guys posted of my progress.
5456	92	6424	LOVE my vag again from San Francisco,Ca	2008-03-20 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I've been dealing with BV for over two years, and it is the most embarassing ailment. I can't talk to anyone about it. I used the 50/50 3% peroxide and water douche, and the smell was gone instantly. I'm also taking the folic acid and acidophilus (normal doses). So far the bog of eternal stench has not returned-even after intercourse. Even though the douche worked, I want to use it as a last resort in the future as I'm wary of excessive douching. I will post back in a week. Hopefully, my vagina will remain friendly between now and then.

5461	92	6429	Shala from Melissa, TX	2008-02-29 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I had been dealing with recurring bouts of BV for the last year. The itching was horrible and the smell was worse. I was so uncomfortable around people that I wouldn't leave my room unless I took a shower first. I would take about three showers a day. I used all the creams my doctor prescribed and used rephresh which only worked temporarily. My gynecologist told me that it was something that I had to deal with and told me to use those feminine wipes and bodywashes. That worked for about 30 minutes! So I took it upon myself to do some research online when I stumbled across this website. I read about lots of women having success using folic acid, acidophilus, and using half water half 3% peroxide douche so I decided to try it immediately. It's only been 24hrs and the smell is already gone!!! This is one remedy that I would recommend to friends and family. It really works for me and I feel so fresh and clean. It's been a year and now I can finally be comfortable enough to go out and have fun! I will post an update in a month to let everyone know if this remedy continued to worked or was temporary like the others. Good luck everyone.

And all i can say is THANK YOU!! i immediatley ran out to Walgreens and got peroxide, folic acid, acidophilus, AND probiotic. i haven't used the probiotic, i got it becuase i read it on some of the comments. i did the peroxide/water douche last night... i didn't read but a few comments that said that it hurt or stung a little... but oh my GOD!! did it hurt! i think i must've been pretty raw, because, i was nearly crying at the pain of it. i was gasping for air it hurt so bad. But i did it a second time (i didn't douche all the liduid in the bottle and figured i might as well do it all) and that time it wasn't nearly as painful. i was sitting on the toilet for a good minute with the pain i felt the first time. and i must say, i woke up this morning, and have yet to see any discharge. i also took the acidophilus and folic acid before i went to bed, we'll see how that works. i think i'm going to do another peroxide/water douche today and tomorrow to be on the safe side and continue with the folic acid and acidophilus.

I tried 3% hydrogen peroxide, folic acid and probiotic acidophilus to cure my cronic BV. I had be suffering from BV for about 2 years and I tried all the medication and nothing worked. It would clear up for a few days then return with a vingance. Everytime I went to the doctor she would always insinuate the I was sleeping around she didnt believe that I had been with the same person for 2 years because Im 21 years old she even gave me medication for TRICH which I didnt need. When I came across this site I was so releaved that something natural finally worked. So to everyone out there thanks for the remedy and does anyone have any suggestions as to do you think I should use this remedy on my boyfriend
5464	92	6432	SHY from Miami, Fl	2008-02-19 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	U got to be kidding me.I can't not believe it! It is finally gone. My bv left in one day! I don't know to be happy that others suffer from this or not! I did the folic acid, perixiode and acidoliphis (sorry for mispellig). I'm cured. I'm still taking the pills and I only douche after sexual intercourse because it trows your ph level off. I'm happy again. Tell a friend!
5465	92	6433	STYLIST from INDIANAPOLIS, IN	2008-02-18 00:00:00	BETTER BUT NOT CURED	2	0	I have been battling bv for approx. 13 years!!!! i have been back and forth to several doctors and even to a specialist in urology!! i have spent sooo much money on doctor visits and prescriptions. i have taken everything possible: metrogel, clindesse, flagyl, metronidizole, rephresh, etc... it all only worked temporarily. as soon as the bv would clear up and i would have sex... 3 days later it would come right back. i have had the same partner for 7 years and have not slept with anyone else. using condoms helps somewhat, but not all of the time. i found this site while desperately searching for some help. this has caused great depression in my life as well as strain on my relationship. my sex life has suffered tremendously, but my partner is really supportive and understanding. he just wants me to try and get to the bottom of this. i have been taking the folic acid and acidopholus pills for about 3wks. now. i started taking them after clindesse cleared up my last bout with bv. i had not had sex in about a month and just had sex this morning. i only washed my private area with hydrogen peroxide after sex, because i did not have a douche bottle. i hope and pray the folic acid and acidopholus pills work at preventing bv from recurring!!! i will post back in a few days to let you all know. if this works i will forever be grateful! this bv problem is really annoying and it ruins my sex life.
5466	92	6434	D from Allentown, USA	2008-02-18 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have suffered from BV for close to 10 years but was too embarassed to say anything to a doctor until this summer. Frankly, I thought they would know since they were rooting around down there during exams! At any rate, I was given antibiotics that didn't work. This issue has greatly affected my life. I saw this website Saturday afternoon and tried the douche of 1/2 water and 1/2 3% hydrogen peroxide. I am also taking Folic acid and Acidophullus (sp?). It is now Monday night and the smell is virtually gone. I will continue to do this teatment and will report any hanges (good or bad.) It may be premature to say this, but I feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders.
5467	92	6435	P Marie from Newcastle, Canada	2008-02-01 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I tried what I had noticed everyone seemed to be recommending as the best cure for BV which is Folic Acid, Acidophillus probiotic and douching with half water and half 3% hydrogen peroxide. I read the board last night after searching endlessly for a home remedy for this annoying problem.
5468	92	6436	MB from Res, VA	2008-01-24 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I CANNOT thank everyone who contributed to the BV Cure thread and spoke about their issues. I believe my issues have been going on and off for over ten years; BTW, I am not even thirty. I contribute the bulk of my issues to sex & BCP.
5469	92	6437	Laurie from Brooklyn, New York	2008-01-23 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have had bouts of BV for the past 6 months chronically. It was first noticed after my boyfriend and I first got together. About 3 wks after we started having sex, I got BV. I was treated with Clindesse the 1st time and it went away. It came back 2 wks later, with a vengeance. I went back to the Doc and she gave me Metrogel. She told me that if it came back she'd consider treating my partner. He is uncircumcised, and she informed me that he can harbor the bacteria easier in his foreskin and keep reinfecting me. Needless to say, he was treated and I still got BV again. So, I searched multiple sites and did a home treatment. I bought a regular box of Massengil douche (just for the bottle), bottle of 3% hydrogen peroxide and a bottle of acidophilus pills. I did one douche of half peroxide and half water (bottled). Then I followed it with all warm water and 4 acidophilus pills emptied into the water. I did this for only 4 days in a row (just to make sure it was gone). I had no smell instantly after it... the itchiness/irritation was completely gone the next morning. It has been 3 months since I did this and I've had no other episodes! Not only am I happy, but so is my boyfriend, and certainly my sex life!!!
5470	92	6438	Mary from Dallas, Texas	2008-01-13 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I must say after suffering from BV for so many years I was really tired and fed up. At this time I do not have any insurance and was suffering from BV for about two (2) days. I was trying to find a location that would sell me over the counter medications to cure BV was instead I came across this web and read all of the comments and home remedies. I must say I rushed to Walgreens where I purchased the Folic Acid and Probiotic Acidophillus, came home douched with half water and peroxide. Took the pills and I feel clean and fresh. No discharge so smell after a couple of hours. It has been 3 days now and still nothing. Thank you so much for this helpful information. May God Bless you all.

5471	92	6439	Michelle from Brooklyn, New York	2008-01-02 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I started having a fishy odor and discharge a few months ago. I at first thought it was because my period was about to begin but when my period ended and the symptoms were still present I got worried. I went to the doc., got tested was told I have BV and she of course prescribed me an antibiotic..I started using home remedies a year ago after a nasty reaction to penicillin because of strep throat (which of course caused me to get a yeast infection..) I found this website before takin the drug she prescribed and based on what others wrote it seems that it may not have helped. I tried the Hydrogen peroxide and H2O, plus I bought folic acid pills and acidophilus. THe first time I used it the odor was gone. I used half Hydrogen peroxide and half H2O in a douche. I could see the discharge coming out. I didnt feel any pain thankfully but I sure felt alot cleaner. By the second night the discharge became thinner. I did the douche for three nights only and now a month after starting the hydrogen peroxide and H2O, plus the pills I feel, look, and smell normal again. I continue to take the pills daily. I made an appointment to make sure the BV is gone, but I feel so happy again... I am thankful I found this site.
5472	92	6440	Crystal from Belleville, IL	2007-12-31 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	All I can say is AMAZING!!! Seems like for the past 2 years, any little things has been throwing me Ph off; even different types of spermicide from condoms. I would be so embarrassed when I would have to go to the doctor smelling like any pond in a local park (smyl). Last night I came across this website and began to read the posts. Ironically, I started noticing the smell two days prior. After reading the posts I immediately rushed to Walgreens where I purchased 800 mcg of Folic Acid, probiotic Acidiphollus and 3% peroxide. Upon returning home I mixed half water and half peroxide in a summer's eve container and douched twice. I waited approximately one hour for results of any kind. All I can say is WOW!!!! The discharge was gone, and the smell was VERY minimal (if you didn't know what u were looking for u wouldn't think there was a smell at all). I then took 1 800mcg Folic Acid pill and 1 Acidiphollus pill. It is now 10:42 a.m. and the smell and discharge is GONE!!!! I just took another dose of the pills after finishing breakfast and now I'm posting my comments. I never really belived in reading blogs and such but I'm so happy I did. I want to thank everyone for sharing this cheap, EFFECTIVE, home remedy as it has helped me tremendously. I plan to take the dosage of pills for the next week to ensure that my vagina in normally balanced; then I may consider taking them twice a week. Thanks to everyone who started Earth CLinic and thanks again to everyone who shared the remedy. I encourage any female with this problem to please try the remedy. What do you have to lose. THIS REALLY WORKS!!! HAPPY NEW YEAR TO ALL AND MAY GOD BLESS EACH OF YOU!!!
5473	92	6441	Jennifer from Miami, FL	2007-12-22 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I came across this website after searching endlessly for a cure for Bacteria Vaginosis. The culture test came back with Heavy Gardenella, which is BV. I've have this horrible smell and itch for 2 years. My bf noticed, and obviously he complained.So the doctor prescribed me metrogel, which worked... but it came back after 4 weeks!! Dammit! Again, I went to see him and complained, and he prescribed it again. I didn't use it this time... I had to give Folic Acid and Acidophilus a shot! As soon as I read this, I went to CVS and bought Folic Acid 800mcg, Acidophilus probiotic and last by not least 3% Hydrogen Peroxide to wash down there with water. Just the first day I drank the pills and immediately the discharge was no longer watery, the smell went away, and the itch was gone!!!!!!! My GOD MY GOD why didn't the doctor tell me that all I needed was some good bacteria to fix my imbalance. This definitely restored my immune system and my LIFE BACK! I can't emphasize how joyful I feel, and I can finally say that my bf was incredibly happy and supportive. I now can celebrate christmas and new years with joy, instead of sadness. GOD BLESS YOU ALL FOR YOUR COMMENTS THAT HELPED ME RESTORE MY LIFE AND MY DEPRESSION IS GONE!

I visited with so many dr's and not one of them could give me a alternative. No explanations to why the imbalance, or how can I restore it.No, no,just a prescription knowing that you will be back. There was one dr that told me "it's impossible for you too have so many" how do you know that it's BV. Did he not hear me when I said that I have suffered with it for 10 yrs? You'd think I know, dah, anyhoo, after reading testimonials, I decided heck, what do I have to lose except for BV, so I tried the 1/2 & 1/2 water and peroxide& water,in the morning, plus folic acid & acidophillis (orally). My goodness what a difference, Thank You all for your suggestions, I pray that it will help others like myself... God Bless You Ladies...
5475	92	6443	V from Panama, Florida	2007-11-13 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I don't normally give comments back, but I am going to this time. I have had a yeast infection or BV for 4 days and thinking yeast first, I treated it with Monostat 1. It did not work, on the 4th day I was more miserable than I was on day one. I do not know how ladies put up with such a nasty condition for so long. Anyway, I dislike going to the doctors very much. I found this site and read your antidotes, then I found a medical site that backed the information about using a certain kind (that most people do not have) of H202 internally. I only have the 3% at home and that is what I used. The medical site does not recommend it for internal use. I do not own a baster or anything else like that. I used a tampon which I tried to soak with a solution of 50% bottled water and 50% H202, but I found it expanded too much in the applicator. In my frustration, I removed the tampon from the applicator and drenched it with straight H202 and used my fingers to push it up into my vaginal cavity. It was messy and a lot of liquid just came dripping back out. I also took paper towels and soaked them in staight H202 and methodically cleaned the entire external area from inside thigh to inside thigh and from start of pubic hair well past the anal opening. I let myself air dry then put on clean cotten underwear with a pad, and went to make a phone call, I talked for 67 minutes. During that time expanse there was a bit of a warm sensation that I felt and a bit of pain (like a cramping pain). After my call was over, I pulled the tampon out, then I literally dumped some more H202 over the entire external area and left myself air dry again. I woke this morning and have checked 3 times so far. No external cheesy stuff, no internal excessive white stuff, no musky smell, and I am pink again. I am going to the store to get some folic acid today also, but I did want to let you know of my success. P.S. I already eat Breyers probiotic yogurt daily regardless of state of health
5499	93	6467	Annmarie from Tampa, FL	2009-03-05 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Remedy for Gallbladder Attacks: I've been having some pretty severe gallbladder attacks for months now and was desperate for relief. Once one of my attacks took me to the hospital, they found tons of stones and recommended removal of the gallbladder. I'm having my surgery tomorrow but had to wait a few weeks between my ER visit and surgery and I had a number of attacks since then. I came online desperately looking for a temporary fix and found the apple juice and apple cider vinegar cure. I was AMAZED and so relieved that this WORKED! I drank one cup of apple juice with 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar and within 15 minutes my attacks stopped immediately! Thank you so much for publishing this information because I was so relieved that this got rid of my attack that I wanted to cry tears of happiness! Also as a note, one night I did not have apple juice and took a shot of 1tbsp of just the apple cider vinegar and this did work as well. A heating pad also helps to relieve any pain until the apple cider vinegar works to relieve the attack.

I have referred to this site several times over the last few years and within the last YEAR I have had serious bouts with BV and frequent Candida/Yeast Infections. I tried EVERYTHING under the sun and didn't want to go back to the doctor AGAIN. Recently after having PROTECTED sex, I began having the usual itching, burning, thick discharge and because there was no odor, assumed it was yeast. I spent almost $60 in OTC meds in vain. I drinking ACV--this made it WORSE. I tried drinking Sea Salt and water to cleanse out my system--no cigar! I tried soaking in the ACV & Salt while douching--this solved my problem for only 1 day. I tried Cranberry concentrate and acidophilus for several days---again, worked temporarily and symptoms returned in full force within a few days. Finally, I realized that this may not be yeast after all and maybe I had another BV infection. So, naturally I logged on to this site and read up on the testimonials for BV cures. Douching with 1/2 cup 3% Hydrogen peroxide and 1/2 cup of water seemed to be a good idea, especially since it didn't require a visit to the grocery store and I'll be darned---my symptoms vanished into thin air (after the burning subsided after 30 seconds, my insides were raw at this point). I used the douche this morning and I cannot believe the results. I ran to the store and bought the Folic Acid and found it on sale for $1.85 (400mcg/350 tablets WOW!). I came home and took 3 Folic Acid tablets and 2 more acidophilus pills and I cannot believe how NORMAL I feel. I am FINALLY back to my normal self again. The itching and redness is gone!!! THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THIS WONDERFUL WEBSITE! YOU ARE TRULY A GODSEND!
5477	92	6445	Grace from Philadelphia, PA	2007-11-07 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have been dealing with what I thought was a yeast infection for almost 9 months this year. Over the summer I went to my family doctor and dropped hundreds of dollars (i do not have health insurance) to get my pap and get std tested because I thought something was severly wrong. My doctor prescribed me Flagyl and told me I had BV. Instantly my symptoms stopped and for once I felt normal again! But this lasted for about a week or so until my symptoms returned. When i found this website I went to the 24 hr grocery store and bought folic acid (400mg), Stress Complex B vitamins and acidophilus pills. I also grabbed some Activia. When I got home I took 4 Folic acid pills, 2 acidophilus pills and one stress complex B pill. Then I soaked a tampon in hydrogen peroxide and inserted it for about 10 mins. When I removed it the odor and the discharge were gone. I don't know if it was the combination of both the vitamins and the peroxide, but it's the next day and I feel BETTER. Thank you SO much for this website, it saved me a ton of sleep, stress and money.
5478	92	6446	Rachel from Queens, NY	2007-10-26 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	All I have to say is that I am so grateful for this website!!! Amazing. I would get a case of bacteria vaginosis and immediately run to my doctor. I was seeing her so often that she would just write me a prescribtion without even an examination. I looked up the bv cure and I read all of the cures. I went out and bought some acidophilus and some folic acid. After a day or two of no results, I tried the half and half of peroxide and water for about 4days but after the second day no smell or discharge. Amazing!!!! I keep checking myself to make sure it's not temporary and not one trace of it. I will continue to take the acidophilus and folic acid but the peroxide and water as a douche was the winner for me. My prayers have been answered because I prayed to find an alternative to conventional medicine for all of my ailments and I can say with confidence that I have thank you. Rachel from New York

I have tried prescription after prescription to no avail. All the other websites state I have to get yet another prescription to keep it under control. I stumbled on this website and I read every comment. I was rather skeptical about douching. Have always been told not to. I tried 1/2 water 1/2 peroxide one morning just to see what would happen. That was 3 weeks ago and I have gotten my period during that time. Guess what! ? No smell! I am so excited. Thank you all for your honest and at home remedies. I will forever tell everyone I know about this site. It has saved my sanity.

I tried it, it worked for a few days. The symptoms came back. I asked my Gynecologist about this method and she said it was really bad to do. She says it can cause blood embolism. Sucks because this was the first thing that worked naturally.
5484	92	6452	Destiny from Newark, New Jersey	2008-04-29 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I came to this site hoping for a cure for my re-current bv/yeast infections. I was tired (and imbarrassed) of calling my Dr. every month for a prescription. And more importantly, with money being tight, I didn't have it to spend. I logged on and found this site and immediately tried the hydrogen peroxide/water (I used a plastic cup and poured equal amounts of each that covered the cotton part of the tampon)on the tampon. It burned for a minute or two then I felt bubbling, but it was tolorable. I drank some Apple Cider Vinegar (2 table spoons and 8 oz of water mix) and mixed a white vinegar and water douch (1/2 and 1/2). I left the tampon in for approx. 30 minutes, then douched an hour later. Again I felt some burning but it was again tolorable. The next morning there were no signs of the "cottage cheese" discharge and I was "so fresh and so clean"! I now have a new remedy that is both affordable and natural. Thanks for the tips.

But the combination of hydrogen peroxide and the Bs with folic acid works great. I also eat a lot of yogurt made from raw milk, eat sauerkraut that is home made and therefore has bacteria from lactic acid fermentation. I have not had BV since I started on these foods.
5486	92	6454	Pam from Central Florida	2008-08-25 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I've been dealing with BV for almost a year. I found that using 3% HP Douche (no water) and holding it in my vagina for 2 - 3 minutes works really well (just squeeze then release when you are ready to let it drain out). Also--a baking soda paste applied to the outside worked like a miracle for the burning and irritation. I simply dab some on when I first get into the shower and then wash it off when I'm ready to get out.

With all the different flu and cold viruses out there I was afraid to go on anti-biotics because of the mutation and resistance that could occur, so I searched on the 'net' and found this web page. I was not a true believer, but figured I'd give it a shot.
5487	92	6455	Bnstdst from Charleston, Wv	2013-03-25 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I found this site about a year ago when I realized no medication was going to cure my BV. Frustrated I started searching home remedies & tried a few with no success! Then I tried the peroxide, acidophilus , & folic acid & it actually worked!! I was VERY skeptical considering all the medication I had taken in the past barely even effected my BV & never made the smell completely go away! I changed my soap, tampons, & pads to unscented & Before bed I used a syringe with half peroxide & half water a few times to flush myself out & crushed a acidphloios pill with like 2 drops of water to make a thick paste & balled it up on the tip of my finger best I could I put it as far inside myself as possible! In the mornings I would take the acidophilous pill orally along with the folic acid & flush myself with the peroxide a few times. I did this for a week but I still orally take the pills & a one a day womens vitamin in hope that it may help the BV from reoccurring! It has been almost a week since my self treatment & still NO SMELL!! I am beyond happy & just pray it stays away!! I am only 25 & have been struggling with this for almost 2 years! I used a lactobacillus acidophilus probiotic with 100 million organisms.
5488	92	6456	Curedinatl from Atlanta, Ga	2012-05-31 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	The following worked for my bv which lasted through 7 consecutive months of alternating gel and pill antibiotics (I pretty much concluded that my period is what triggered the bv each month):
5489	92	6457	Marina from Grants Pass, Or	2012-02-26 00:00:00	BETTER BUT NOT CURED	2	0	Back with 6 week report update! This has been an especially frustrating situation to tackle. My brain hurts from researching. I felt like the BV was gone up until 2 days before my period (I started this treatment the day after my last period ended). I have become paranoid and am constantly doing scent checks, odor shifted right before my period & my period had a slightly unpleasant odor but better than past months. Since I felt off, I put tea tree oil on my tampons before inserting them, I just could not handle pads again this month. T. T. Oil made me feel more 'sterile' & like I had some extra bacterial protection inside. 2 days after my period ended I could smell fish malodor. It was VERY faint but it was there. I did 2 nights of H2O2 douches followed by vaginal probiotic insertion. I also switched back to my original probiotics after trying the Fem kind and feel better about these. No odor and I am having sex again. I am inserting a probiotic after sex and still taking a probiotic orally daily. I am still taking all my supplements daily. 1) The femdolphlius noticeably did not work for me as a Vag. Insert. Maybe it was not active when it arrived??? I'm not sure but I know switching back to a different version by the same compay purchased cold locally has a better effect on me. 2) I just started having sex again last week and I can absolutely tell his DNA is THE contributing factor to this issue. So as long as I am with him I feel I will have to be hyper-vigilant about maintaining my V-flora balance. 3) To PREVENT REOCCURRENCE: I came across an interesting remedy note today, it suggested that menstruation is the time when the flora and pH gets askew especially in women with V-infections. I experienced this. The note on prevention referred to using boric acid capsules vaginally as a method of killing all bacteria, like an anti-biotic. I believe the H2O2 douche does the same exact thing. The note suggested using the boric acid capsules vaginally at night during your period for four months along with taking pro-b's and all the other stuff mentioned here. I used the tea tree oil on my tampons with the same intention: to not allow the bacteria to get out of hand because I noticed the environment had noticeably shifted. The important remedy notation is: you should bump up your treatment during your period at least for 4 months after starting this treatment. If you are already following this method then it would be a good idea to do a bacterial house cleaning at the end of your period (H2O2 douche V. Inserted probiotics for a couple days) for four consecutive months. I started treatment 6 weeks ago. I don't feel cured but I feel like I have more control over it now & that eventually I will rebalance my flora & now know how to manage it better going forward and no what is going on and am aware of the signs of unbalanced. I have been mostly odor-free for the entire time even during and after sex, so far!
5490	92	6458	Marina from Grants Pass, Oregon	2012-01-28 00:00:00	BETTER BUT NOT CURED	2	0	I want to thank everyone for all of their posts. It's too bad people don't actually follow up after a "24 hour miracle cure". I would like to know more about long-term results. I am 43 years old and only just found out about this BV - I feel terribly about all the mean thoughts I've ever had in a public restroom over the years. CLEARLY, you do know when you smell that badly. It is horrible to be stinky from your V. One thing that surprised me is, I have had a terrible phobia of having odor 'down there' because of a girl I knew in college. When BV took over my life and sex life, my WORST fear came true, only worse because my stench was far nastier then I ever imagined was possible. It made me gag one night after sex and I had to wonder, how in the world does my bf even want to get near that foul grossness ? ? ? ? He never complained once and it honestly does not bother him like it does me. One thing I have noticed in the posts is that I think too many people, like with antibiotics, stop too soon when then notice results. It is bacteria you are trying to manipulate so it is very much like antibiotic treatment and needs to be followed for 7-10 consecutive days. The study people reference is a peroxide solution douche 1 time per day for 7-10 days. This is the treatment time I am going to follow. After you do the peroxide wash, wait a few minutes and then insert a high quality probiotic. Do not use flavored wafers or anything that contains sugar, read the ingredients. The first time I used a pro-b I had on hand. The capsule is thick and it basically stuck to the side of my who-ha, I did not like this. I found the refrigerated kind have thinner gel caps that break down more readily and don't stick or cause grittiness. I like to sterilize a needle and poke several pinholes into the capsule so that I know it is releasing faster through the capsule. I insert it as far as I can. I do a 50/50 peroxide solution wash at night only and insert 1 probiotic 5 minutes later. I insert another pro-B in the morning. I'm all about organic cotton panty liners at the moment. I also started taking a high quality, easily digestible pre-natal once-a-day multi-vitamin that can be taken without food. It does not make me sick like others. It has 800 mg of Folic Acid, probiotics & other goodies. It is a great multi-vitamin in general for women no matter what your fertility interests are. It will not hurt you in anyway if you are not pregnant or post menopause. For the 10 days treatment I am taking 1 vitamin in the am & pm and I am also taking 1 capsule of a refrigerated 10 billion, 6 strain probiotic orally twice a day. I intend to drop down to 1 a day for the vitamin & probiotic after the 10 remedy phase. I have actually been wanting to add both of these daily but I just didn't stick with it. NOW, I especially have reason to stick with it. My diet is very healthy and I still got BV. I believe somehow when my bits mix with my man's bits (DNA, sweat, skin cells) it somehow creates some kind imbalance inside me or an acid???? I say acid because of the burning/itching feeling after sex. Neither of us has an STD. I started the process only 4 days ago. So far so good. I'm posting now because I wanted to add my tips and observations. I feel grateful because the man is gone for one month so I have time to rebalance and not get my new environment distrubed. I think you must abstain from sex during your treatment. You have to get the upper hand on the bacteria and sex just keeps encouraging replenishing the bad environment. I plan to use the syringe with a weaker solution after sex in the future when I go pee. It's probably a good idea to toss a pro b up there once in awhile for maintenance as well if this is a reoccurring problem. If you ever use a syringe type thing, (needle without a needle) be sure to go S-L-O-W-L-Y & don't force the plunger. You will create too much pressure & can possibly push the infection up higher by blasting in the solution with force. You want to slowly flood the V-canal with the solution and let it do its thing for a few minutes then release it. I put a towel in the bathtub and lay back with my legs up.

After a year of continually dealing with bacterial vaginosis and taking every antibiotic they make for it (multiple times! ) I had really given up. Then I decided to take the situation into my own hands and try some homeopathic remedies, which led me to this site. I decided to try the Hydrogen peroxide, Acidophilus, and Folic acid regimen. First I went to the drug store and bought a summer's eve douching kit, a few bottles of hydrogen peroxide, and folic acid. My routine for the first 2 weeks went as follows:

As everyone who has experienced such an episode will attest, it is very painful and a mixture of as little as 1-2 tablespoons of ACV in 8 oz. glass of water or apple juice or half/ half provides almost immediate relief. Unfortunately, the only solution medics offer is surgery rather than prevention. I have tried to modify my diet but that doesn't always work so this info is much appreciated.
5493	93	6461	Kim F from Chicago, Illinois	2009-11-12 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I am 39 years old and have been having gallbladder issues off and on. I have done one effective liver/gallbladder cleanse that was very helpful, but the power of doing the cleanse is to do them continually until no more stones are left - which I haven't done yet... The best info I have found (of course in addition to earthclinic.com :))is available on sensiblehealth.com and researching Andreas Moritz. I wanted to add my review for the 8 oz apple juice and 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar. I started to get the telltale soreness under my right rib cage yesterday morning so I took the apple juice and apple cider vinegar at the end of the day yesterday and then again this morning. Ahhh, the relief! I still have slight soreness, but no pain. I highly recommend this remedy, but can't stress enough how much a gallbladder cleanse can truly help out in the long run. Best wishes in your personal quest for health. :)
5494	93	6462	Sharik from Arcata, Ca	2009-10-20 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have, for years, had a disintegrating gall bladder and, because I am allergic to anesthesia, have chosen to live with it. When I have an attack, I use 1/4 Cup ACV in 8 oz. of organic apple juice and the attack goes away within minutes (usually 15). I keep small bottles of apple juice around for just such times. When I use it for a cleanser or for any other reason, I also use apple juice as a sweetener, usually the frozen kind. Just pour a little into your water bottle, along with the ACV and fill with distilled water. For some reason it makes it much more palatable. Hope this helps those who find it difficult to take with water alone.

I came across this web site and seen the Apple Cider and the ACV remedy. I was telling my hubby about it and he went to the store and bought the stuff. About 10 mins later, I was free of pain. =) I dont take pain meds because I breastfeed my daughter so, alot of times I deal with the pain. But I am pretty excited that there is natural stuff out there to help. I cant have mine removed because my hubby was laid off and now we dont have insurance. So thank you for this website! =0)

I read it and tried the ACV?/Apple juice and thankfully was helped in about 30 minutes.I was diagnosed with a 2 cm gallstone over 10 years ago. Thought I was having a heart attack then. They sent me to the surgeon then, and I thought then , not for me. Got to try something else first. Did a few gall bladder flushes and not much happened. I have attacks now and then. Not as bad as the first. Doesn't always happen with fatty meals. strange. I love to travel and it does worry me if I am in another country and it happens. At least I have something I can do at home!!! I was wondering how to post. I joined the email. Want to thank people for there stories and words of encouragement.

I have never felt so ill. I happened on this board and saw the apple cider vinegar remedy. I did not have juice, so I used one tablespoon of ACV in plain, room temperature water. I was genuinely skeptical, and I expected the concoction to make me sick. Quite the opposite was true! I was absolutely over the attack within in 15 or 20 minutes, and I was able to sleep (the attack kept me up all night). Thanks to all who made this recommendation - it worked a miracle for me!
5500	93	6468	JoAnn from Cleveland, OH	2009-02-22 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	When I was growing up my Mom read every book by Adele Davis, a nutritionist. Back then in the '60's the Honey and Apple Cider Vinegar Drink was promoted in the book for healthy living. Mom used to keep a glass jar of it on our kitchen counter for us to drink when we wanted. Doing so resulted in our having fewer upset stomachs, reduced heart burn, and a general sense of feeling good. Recently when I began having gallbladder colic, I turned to your site for relief and low and behold the suggestion of "apple cider vinegar" was suggested in water to relieve the discomfort. I tried it after years of not drinking it. Like the folks above stated, it worked and worked quickly. It was such a relief to rediscover this remedy as I had been suffering several times a week with the biliary colic that accompanied my gall bladder disease. No longer did I have to suffer for hours until it subsided. I just had my gall bladder removed and feel so much better. But like others tell me who also had theirs removed, our liver can still make stones and they still continue with some digestive upsets. So, my plan is to drink my honey and vinegar water daily to promote good digestion along with digestive enzymes to help me to digest my food. My Mom did know best, and at a time in our world when few bought into such ideas. So glad she did and so glad you all reminded me of the wisdom of this simple, yet healthful drink.

Every time I eat something with too much fat for my body to handle, I get a pain in my gallbladder several hours later. Sometimes it will last for days and the rib becomes sore. I guess they call these gall bladder attacks. I came across the apple cider vinegar in apple juice remedy on this site 2 weeks ago and immediately went out and bought both. It worked within 20 minutes! No more gall bladder pain! I am going to wait until the spring and do a gall bladder cleanse. I was going to do one now, but my acupuncturist told me spring is the time to do organ cleanses.
5502	93	6470	Tasha from Springfield, OH	2009-01-09 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	So glad I have found this site for 2 years now I have been having pains from gallstones and last December of 2007 I had surgery and had my gallbladder removed hoping that would have been the end to my pains. Well to my surprise less than 3 months later was bent sideways in pain again and there was no denying that kind of pain I knew it was my gallstones but didnt know if that could be possible knowing that I had my gallbladder removed, so did some research and found out it was very possible and that the stones could be lodged in my bile ducts or pancreas. So the pains kept coming and I have no insurance and did not go to the doctor but the pains were to the point where I had to find something which brings me to thanking all the great advice I received when I come across this site. Last night the attack of pains hit me and in seconds was unbearable tried some ACV in a warm glass of water and the pain was gone within a minute thanks so much for this site it is very helpful

Lucky me, I had both apple juice and ACV in the house! I tried it twice, as the first time I didn't really have a full shot of the ACV. (nasty tasting) It took a while (30 minutes) but I am FINE NOW! I can't believe it! I am SO thankful for this web site and those who posted before me! Being so close to Christmas, it's hard to get into see anyone. THANK YOU ALL!
5505	93	6473	Serena from Helena, MT	2008-09-25 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I was having gall bladder attacks when I was about two months pregnant. My OB/GYN wanted me to get a surgery consult to have it removed after the birth. That freaked me out a little so I asked my dad about what to do. He suggested that I drink 12 ounces of organic apple juice for 3 or 4 days, to help soften the stones or sludge. Then, the last thing on the fourth day on an empty stomach, drink 4oz of squeezed, strained, grapefruit juice mixed with 2oz of olive oil. Then lay down on my right side with my right knee as close to my chest as possible. Then, before going to bed put 2 tsp of magnesium citrate and swirl into 6 oz of water and drink. Should pass stones the next morning. I, being pregnant, didn't want to do anything too drastic. So, I modified this by diluting 1/4 Cup of ACV with water to about a Cup and drinking and then laying on my right side for the evening. I haven't had an attack since and it's been 7 months.
5506	93	6474	Jody from Westlake, Ohio	2008-03-24 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have been having attacks for a little over a year thinking that I had aniety problems. In the last week, I discovered that I have Gall stones and I have had an attack everyday for the last seven days. I tried taking a very hot shower and then a cold shower to shock my system, while the pain subsided nothing seemed to work. I found this site and I happened to have Apple Cider Vinegar handy along with Apple Juice. After I found this site and read the comments others posted, I tried the vinegar with Apple Juice. It has been twenty minutes and the pain is diminishing. I am very happy to land on a temporary relief for the pain. Thank you!

I drink organic local unfiltered apple juice, and organic cider vinegar (with the mother). I drank it luke warm in the day time because I read that nothing too hot or cold is good for the liver, that it will cause pain. I drank it frequently throughout the day and evening. I drank it warm at night when it was chilly. At first I drank a half a gallon of apple juice and now I drink a quarter of a gallon and I have used about an ounce or more in a big glass and reduced the ACV proportionally in a smaller glass. It was in the kind of pain that evryone told me to get my gall bladder removed. I read about this treatment so I tried it and I started feeling better right away, and the pain came back once when it was stressful and I ran out of juice and cider. I will see a doctor for examinations, but I can't afford to right now.

The interesting thing to note for me was that I had an Ayurvedic doctor tell me to take, upon first rising, 2 tsp ACV 1 tsp lemon juice mixed in a glass of water. I had done this religiously for almost 11 months and have had awesome results with no attacks. The funny thing (or uber painful thing) is that I just woke to a major attack and am feeling that my 2 days of missed morning ritual has had an effect on my system! I see how the effects of NOT taking my morning "alkalizer" I call it, can wreak havoc on me. Here it is Christmas morning at 3:14am and just having my symptoms slowly subside. Hmm, maybe I'll run into Santa! I truly believe that this morning "alkalizer" balances my system.

5512	93	6480	Zella Sauer from Terre  Haute, Indiana	2008-09-17 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Hello, First let me say I love this site! I plan to try many many things here. I came here because of a gallbladder attack. I was sooo sick with this last attack, and I am not working and have no medical insurance. So I started out with AVC in apple juice and wow !! I felt much better (((but a very wonderful side effect occurred, which I wasn't expecting.... I have been holding water a lot lately in my ankles, and I have been drinking lots of water to help rid my body and eating very little to no salt, but still some puffiness.... I have been using ACV for 3 days now and my ankles and lower legs are TINY again !!! I can't believe it !!!) I have since then been reading all the wonderful things ACV does so I am a believer and will be taking it from now on.))) I did start out drinking the regular kind from the store in apple juice, but I have bought the organic ACV now... My second subject is LETTUCE. I wanted faster relief on my gallbladder and eating a chunk of lettuce makes your stomach and gas build up from all of this ease down quite fast ...and it works! THANKS My third subject is comfrey.... comfrey has many many used more than just bones.... I have it growing in my yard, and ((of course I haven;t been using it for about 1 month)) but that was me being dumb))) anyway I have a whole read out on comfrey and all of it's cures... but it may be too long for here. One thing it is for is the digestive system in your body. I usually cut me about 8 to 10 leafs each morning and bring them to a simmer and eat them. They are delicious and taste like rough spinach. My mom drinks comfrey tea. It is supposed to heal any upsets in your digestive track from your stomach right on down to your bowls, and ground comfry root is powerful stuff. Here is a small readout on just a few of it's healing powers...... ((Tea of the leaves or decoction of the root was traditionally used for arthritis, respiratory problems, persistent coughs, pleurisy, bronchitis, bronchial pneumonia, lung disease with dry cough, lung congestion, quinsy, whooping cough, consumption, metritis, periostitis, gastrointestinal ulcers, ulcerative colitis, internal hemorrhage (lungs, bowel, stomach), bleeding piles, bloody urine, bladder infections, prostate infections, cystitis, leukorrhea, excessive menstrual flow, scrofula, anemia, wasting disease, DIGESTIVE & STOMACH PROBLEMS, spitting blood, colds, nasal congestion, diarrhea, and dysentary.)) I know a lady of 98 still going strong, a dear friend of my mom's, gave a plant to my mom and she in turn gave me some starts from it years ago, to help us with stomach problems and I did use it for 3 months once ... and was wonderfully healthy and no digestive problems at all... then I moved and my landlord would not allow me to pull it up. So it took me years to find it again and only this year, I have plenty... so along with my AVC, lettuce and comfrey I plan to get healthy and well.... ohh and I am just starting to use organic coconut oil on my skin ... will let everyone know .... :)

Unf it was too late and the stores open only had apple juice from concentrate and non organic apple cider vinegar. I started taking it before the pain was 100% (compared to previous episodes). I was careful to also stay upright the whole time.

I now drink at least a glass a day, I chose the all natural stuff personally, and if I have eaten something that I know will probably trigger an attack, I drink an extra glass before I go to sleep. So far, most excellent results for three weeks now, no attacks, and no pain. I wish someone else who gets attacks would try for awhile and let me know if it works for them or not. Just thought I'd share my good luck with something semi-preventative with you all.

This has worked for for four people that I have shared it with. Get some Queen of the Medow (also called Jo Pye Weed ) root. This plant grows wild in many areas of the country. IT can be purchased at some health food stores and can be found on Ebay. It is very, very cheap. Take some of this root and make a tea. Only one cup and they will pass. One friend of mine had suffered for two years with these and even in and out of the hospital. One day while he was at my house he asked me to look in this old book to see if anything was in it about kidney stones and this is where I saw this cure. It is a old indain remedy. The next day my friend called me and told me he made a cup of this tea and about 45 min after drinking it he passed them. This has been over eight years ago and he has had no problems since.

First you must soften with any numerous kidney cleanses. i.e. a week of apple juice.  then you must cleanse with epson salts and then do the lemon or grapefruit and olive oil routine.  It may take several tries but it works. when my wife and i did it last year we only got gravel because the cleanse had broken up the stones.  We are in our 70's and this was our first attempt at removing stones.  We plan to do this on a yearly basis with all our detox programs.

I took 2 pain pills and tried to go back to sleep. By 630 my pain was 9 on a scale of 10 and I know the 10 it can reach. Looked on the internet and found your site. I live in Costa Rica and went out to my lemon tree grabbed 4 lemons. Mixed with olive oil. Within an hour I was pain free. Totally amazed! Not sure if it will be returning, but I have a whole tree full of lemons and the last drink has lasted at least 12 hours.

Found this web page (thank God) and took first dose of 2 oz olive and 2 oz lemon juice, washing down with glass of water, about 9am.

I wasn't sure if this was where I should comment. It worked pretty well, although it took a few minutes to kick in, but then lasted for at least an hour.

I had read about this remedy, but since it really makes no sense to me I never tried it. However, I finally caved in and did the olive oil/lemon juice mixture twice per day starting yesterday. By this morning the bladder spasm and pain was greatly improved and this afternoon I had some mucus come out with my urine. About an hour later out came that darn stone! Who knows how it works or if it is coincidence, but I am very happy the pain in gone.

My first bout of kidney stones was on Easter Sunday 2005 at the age of 43 - I didn't know if I had injured my back, burst my appendix, or had kidney stones. In extreme pain, my wife rushed me to the hospital's ER where a long ridiculous process started. To make a long story short, a CT scan found a lodged 4mm stone between my left kidney and urthea and after 2 nights of being drugged up on morphine and an IV drip continuosly going, I left the hospital still in pain. The stone did eventually pass.
5527	94	6495	Thames from Philadelphila, Pa	2011-07-24 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I went to the hosptial on 6 30 2011 with back pain with a mri test I was told I had a 6.2mm kidney stone, I was giving pain meds and sent home. Two days later a friend told me of this home remedy of 2oz of olive oil and 2oz of 100% lemon juice followed by water. I was still in pain taking pain meds and did the remady again and as of today 7 24 2011 went pee and there it was a 6.2 mm stone, so the remedies must work. I have a picture to prove itÂ I've been dealing with stones for years and first time I ever passed one that big without medical help.
5528	94	6496	East  from Morgan Hill, Ca, Us	2011-06-17 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I am so happy I found this site. I had a kindey stone pass from my kidney with alot of blood and pain and on it's way out it got stuck. I did what the doctor told me... Had to return twice in the course of the following 2 1/2 months and I had pain daily. I was taking pain pills that helped very little and drinking alot of water and I kept believing it would pass as the doctor said but it just got worse and when I had to urinate I sometimes had a sensation of tiny little knives stabbing me after I finished... OUCH! I was ready to go back a fourth time and it was a depressing thought because I now expected no results and since it was stuck I was reading about the alternate method of getting the stone to pass and it was not something to look forward to so I tried the olive oil and lemon juice gladly... Took it twice the first day and the next morning I drank another one (not as bad tasting as one would expect! )... And an hour or so later it passed! NO MORE PAIN! I am so thrilled... Thanks you so much for this site and for the advice!

My Urologist indicated that I needed surgery (PNL) to remove these stones.

(The pain actually feels much lower) This last week was the worst. Finally used 2 oz lemon juice/2 oz olive oil followed by LOTS of water for two days. Also used a prescription of Rapiflo from my urologist. Stone passed on the third morning. What a relief!

5534	94	6502	Robert from Everett, Wa	2011-02-01 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	After going to the doc and learning I had my first kidney stone, my wife, who is all about natural cures, happened upon this site to learn about the olive oil and lemon juice remedy. When I returned home about 8:30 pm, I set up 3 shot glasses and into each one put half lemon juice and half OO. I downed all 3 in succession, and followed with 2 large glasses of water. After 30 minutes, I downed 1 more shot of the mixture, followed by 1 glass of unsweetened cranberry juice. For every hour after that, I drank another glass of water. By this time my abdomen was huge with liquids, but nothing was coming out- just the usual trickle and then it would stop, despite the urgent feeling of constantly needing to go. After about 5 hours, I actually had the urge to go No. 2. I got on the throne and pushed for the bowel movement and immediately the stone shot out at the same time and I finally flowed with urination again. I never thought I would take that for granted, but I have a new appreciation for being able to urinate normally. So Yes, I'm a believer in the OO and lemon juice, so if this feeling ever returns, I'll know exactly what to do. Thanks to the people on this site who provided the information to get better. I would still be in pain without you!

5536	94	6504	Jp from Buffalo, Ny	2010-08-17 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Olive oil & lemon juice seems to have cured my ureter stone. 5 days ago a CT scan revealed the stone. Today was my follow-up x-ray to see if the stone moved positions. This morning a friend emailed this link, so I made and drank the cocktail 2.25 times prior to my appointment scheduled 4.5 hours later in the day. I figured it couldn't hurt to try. My first dose was around 10am. My x-ray was at 3pm. When I consulted with the urologist immediately after my x-ray he said the stone was gone. Twice I used the full recipe of 2oz of each ingredient and one time I used 25% of the recipe because I ran out of lemon juice. I went on an empty stomach until the x-ray. I'm scheduled for a follow-up in 4 months.
5537	94	6505	Wendy Jo from Bellevue, Wa	2010-04-15 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Alleluia for lemon juice & olive oil! I have endured the passage of kidney stones since I was in my 20's. I am now almost 50 and just recently suffered another kidney stone attack. After using the usual pain meds and massive amounts of water, I was still in tremendous pain, nauseated, weary, and still no stone after 6 days. I chatted with my naturopath and he recommended I start taking magnesium supplements. I did this and it definitely helped ease the pain level so that I could get by on over-the-counter pain meds. But still no stone. I then found this website and the many testimonials for the lemon juice & olive oil remedy. I thought I would give it a try - far better than going through another surgery. I used 3 oz of lemon juice & 1 oz of olive oil (just couldn't quite get myself to do 2 full ounces). Followed that with at least 32 oz of water in about 10 minutes. I did 2 oz of lemon juice and 1 oz of olive oil followed by 32 oz of water again the next day - twice. Went to bed without any pain, woke up in the morning and passed the largest, most jagged stone I've ever passed. What a relief. Thanks to everyone who has taken the time to tell their story - you gave me the hope & gumption to try something new. I hope my story can do the same for someone else.
5538	94	6506	Agyarko from Iowa City, Iowa, Usa	2010-04-06 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I was taken to the emergency room for pain in the groin. After a few tests including a CT scan, I was diagnosed with kidney stones. I had a 4mm stone (in my kidney) and I was given medication to help it pass and to help control the pain. All this happened on a Tuesday. By Friday morning, I had been drinking over 90 fluid ounces of water daily, pain had been on and off (in groin and lower back), there was no obvious improvement and I had given up on the prescribed medications (meds). During this time, I had been reading about kidney stones and low and behold, stumbled upon earthclinic.com on Saturday evening (had not taken any of the meds since Friday morning). I saw all the 'yeas' for the olive oil and lemon juice concoction and decided to give it a try. And I'm glad I did. I measured exactly 2 fluid ounces of extra virgin olive oil and 2 fluid ounces of freshly squeezed lemon juice, mixed it up, drank it (tasted great, the aftertaste is especially delicious - maybe it's just me) and drank 32 FL OZ of water over the next 3 minutes or so. In about 60 minutes the pain subsided. I later went to bed and slept all night with no pain. Sunday afternoon, I took the same mixture, and drank 40 FL OZ of water in about 3 minutes. Sunday evening whiles in bed it seemed like something was moving in the general region. I could feel it so I got out of bed, drank some more water and went back to bed (only second night of pain-free sleep since Tuesday). Monday morning, I took the same mixture followed by 32 FL OZ of water. By about 12:30pm, during one of the multiple urges to urinate, I could tell something was stuck somewhere. With almost no pain, the stone passed and I was absolutely overjoyed!! I am grateful for the mixture of olive oil and lemon juice, and the over 30 FL OZ strong backing of water!! And for Earth Clinic for relieving me of my agonizing pain. Thank you all!! I should also add that I drank about 100 FL OZ of water through out each day and I am in my 20's. To summarize: a 4mm stone was in my kidney and it passed in less than 48 hours (Saturday evening to Monday afternoon) of drinking a teaspoon-stirred mixture of 2 FL OZ of olive oil and 2 FL OZ of lemon juice (3 times) and immediately following, about 30 FL OZ of water (3 times). I am in my 20's and very happy today. A big thank you to Earth Clinic and to everyone who shared their stories!!!
5539	94	6507	Holly from Portland, Or, Usa	2010-04-04 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	KIDNEY STONES: 2 oz lemon juice, 2 oz olive oil, 1-2 x a day for 3 days until stone passed. (Don't do more than this or you might get sick/nauseous. Absolutely no pain. AMAZING!! CURED!! I don't need to add to the hundreds already here, but here's the story. My husband is a physician, we KNEW what the pain was. It was 3 days of intense pain for my husband. The only thing that helped was breathing exercises. My husband was in tears, he felt intense nausea, and we finally broke down and went to the ER to get something for the pain b/c he was missing his first day of work in a new job. Even after getting morphine, he was crumpled on the floor in screaming pain. my mother called to tell about Lemon juice, we asked the Dr. and of course he had no idea about it, so we left with a $5,000 bill...for nothing. Went straight to the store, with my husband crying in the car (he NEVER cries), got the lemons, and there was no more pain and it passed 3 days later. Crazy. His was about 3 mm, calcium stone. THANK YOU EARTH CLINIC!
5540	94	6508	Mike T. from San Diego, Ca	2010-03-14 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	WOW - you people on this website are amazing. I really think this had to be a bunch of pookey dust (i.e., lemon juice and olive oil). I've had the weirdest symptoms for 2 weeks (first week was a weird combination of fever and chills every night followed by a second week of great discomfort and finally absolute pain last night down somewhere in my urinary tract.). At first I thought may be I was having a problem with my prostate and then for last several days I figured I was having a bad uirnary tract infection). It's now 4:30 a.m. (as I write) and at 3 a.m. I finally work up (again with the pain) and thought, maybe I'm passing a stone or something. So I found this website and thought, 'what the heck i'll give this crazy potion a try' before heading off to the hospital later today. So I squeezed out a lemon through in a bunch of olive oil, chugged it, and then chugged about 4 large glasses of water behind it(thinking these people on the website must be nuts, those that say something'll happen in 30 minutes) and honest to god, not even 20 minutes later, I had to pee and watched carefully and out plunked a 'thing' with my pee, looked to me like an old filling from a tooth but a little smaller, so I guess this is a stone, eh? I never would've believed this nonsense would work. All I can say is thanks-a-billion for this website. These past 2 weeks have been a real pain (honestly I was thinking I had something really bad and that it probably wasn't something as simple as a stone). I'm 50 years old - so i guess I probably should've figured it out sooner, but what can I say this was my first one, so the thought didn't occur to me. You guys are brilliant.
5541	94	6509	Aaron from Knoxville, Tn	2010-02-20 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I've experienced the joy of kidney stone attacks for 12 years off and on, (33 yr male). Monday I spent the night in ER with a return visit Wednesday. Friday the urologist scheduled me for surgery with enthusiasm, I might add. Disgusted at the thought of the invasive procedure and the $$$$, I searched the web for any sign of hope. Friday I found your site. At 12pm I took a shot of the "tonic" 3oz olive oil, 3oz lemon juice. Not bad taste. Followed it with 1 liter of water over the next 5-10 minutes. Before bed (about 9pm) I took another shot, 2oz. olive oil, 2oz. lemon juice - followed by about 1 liter of water over next 10 minutes. I was still having back pain and discomfort to a slightly lesser degree but it was tolerable unlike the previous 4-5 consecutive days. Next morning (9am) I took my third shot 2oz. olive oil, 2oz lemon juice, followed by lots of water throughout the morning. Frequenting the bathroom often over the course of the morning, I noticed my "flow" was increasing in pressure and ease. HAPPY to announce, at 12:30pm I birthed my largest stone to date: a 4 mil jagged, ugly dude. However I did it with the slightest of discomfort. I will return to the urologist on Monday bearing the bad news for him; no car payment from my surgery. Thank You for the help, I will return to your site in the future and spread the word. -Aaron-
5564	94	6532	Scooter from Knoxville, TN	2009-07-12 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Yea! This is the second time I have had to use the lemon juice/olive oil mixture. I used ita couple of years ago and passed several stones. I started having problems a few weeks ago with stones and started using the mixture again. I think I have passes 4 or 5 stones this time on my right side. I must be getting used to the pain because it doesn't hut as bad as my first one more than 15 years ago. It seems like I have a problem about every two years or so. I am going to drink a mixture of the lemon juice/olive oil once a week just to keep myself cleaned out.
5542	94	6510	Mike K from Selkirk, Ny	2010-02-17 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I am scheduled for surgery Mar 18. Have a 6mm stone in left ureter and 11mm stone in right kidney. About a week ago mixed up 2oz olive oil/2oz lemon juice and drank it followed by lots of water. Not too bad going down, but I have a strong stomach. But nothing happened. Repeated the concoction 3 days ago. Last night noticeable pain, but not anything like what caused my ER visit a month ago. Took a pain pill and got to sleep. Came back home from xcntry skiing today and went to bathroom for a BM. Got up and spotted a urine colored "smutz" about the size of a silver dollar on the side of the bowl with consistency similar to mucus. I don't recall sensation of urination but there it was. I'm 65 year male and I've never seen anything like it. Now, 2 hours later, all achiness and sensation of pressure on my left side is gone. I'm convinced something about those two stones has changed for the better. When I get my next xray I'll post an update.

He was in the ER all night. When he came home I looked up stones on this site and he took the remedy. The pain was really bad but now he's pain free, and Happy !
5544	94	6512	Shannon from Ottawa, On	2009-12-16 00:00:00	SIDE EFFECTS	5	0	I had an ultrasound done about a month ago, that showed a kidney stone in each kidney, around 4mm. They were not causing any pain. I then went home to research kidney stones as i didn't know much about them, and found myself terrified to find that they are associated with horrible pain, worse than childbirth! I came across this website and decided to give it a try. What I did was squeeze some fresh lemon juice (approx. 8 ounces) and i drank it over about an hours time. I also had a couple spoonfuls of Olive Oil with my dinner. I drank about 1 liter of water in the couple hours following this. Felt nothing at first, then about 4 hours later got bad stomach cramping and had diarrhea. Was also nauseous. Cramping remained for about an hour. Then had urge to pee and went. Didn't see anything. No idea if this did anything for my stones...but i guess it didn't agree with my body lol. Will update to say if it worked or not!
5545	94	6513	Bill from Capecod, Ma	2009-12-11 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Hi. 53 yr old male. Got my first stone out of the blue on Sat. 12/8. Had no idea what was going on, pain was excruciating but stopped after 4 hours. Thought maybe a stone, but when pain stopped I didn't know for sure. No pain at all Sunday or Mon. am. Around 3 pm Mon. pain started again, more gradual then pretty sore. Called my primary-sent me to ER. IV killed pain, CT scan said 4MM stone. Go home and drink, with percocet for pain. Drank Mon night, all day Tues, probably 2 gallons, all morning Wed. no pain, no stone passed. Found this site and said what the hell. Mixed and drank the Extra Virgin Olive Oil and Lemon Juice, 2oz,each at 2:30 Pm. Kept drinking water all evening and through the night, whenever I had to get up to urinate. Got up Thurs. 5:15 am, urinated (what else) had breakfast, still no pain no stone. About 6:30 am had urge to urinate, after having gone 15 mins. earlier, out pops stone, completely painlessly!! I have no idea if it was the mix or the 3 days of water, but whatever it was it worked. I am probably the most skeptical person you could find re: home remedies, but as someone else said, give it a try, what do you have to lose (except a stone!)

After reading the proposed cures I decided to get her to try olive oil and lemon, as it was the treatment that had the most positive answers. I mixed her same parts olive oil, any brand, and lemon, just following the general instructions. Lots of water after the drink.

I woke up yesterday morning with excruciating pain centered on the lower right flank of my back. I was also not able to urinate as I normally would and the pressure kept building up. After googling a few pages I was able to find the Earth Clinic site and with over two hundred Yeas for the Olive Oil & Lemon Juice treatment I decided to give it a try. I mixed Two Ounces of Extra Virgin Oil with Two Ounces of store brand Lemon Juice concentrate which I was able to keep down. I also took two over the counter Naproxen Sodium pain killers and drank two eight ounce glasses of water.

5550	94	6518	Kim from Bethlehem, Ga	2009-10-30 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I used to get kidney stones all the time but by age 50 I was tired of going to hospital being sent home medicated for pain and paying a small fortune for the "treatment". then I learned about squeezing 4 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice and mixing it with an equal amount of Extra Virgin Olive Oil. This is to be swallowed all at once and followed by a large glass of water. Usually within 24 hours, the stones will come out on their own while urinating, sometimes broken down into a little pile of what looks like sand. Take this concoction at the first signs of (what is for many of us) the all too familiar lower back pain.
5551	94	6519	Jeffrey from San Jose, Ca	2009-10-27 00:00:00	NAY	1	0	I took the Olive Oil/Lemon Juice treatment for my kidney stone. I wish that I could say that it has given me any degree of relief at all. It has not. I tried it for 3 days hoping for any diminishment in the pain as an indicator that it was starting to work. I blended 2 ozs of each three times a day. Easy to do. Fairly easy to swallow. Certainly cheap enough. But there was not a drop in pain at all. Maybe the size of my stone(1.5 cms) was also factor in the failure of this remedy. I don't think that I saw a single stone that was as large. Still after 3 days you would think that there would be something of a change after all the positive testimonials that I read last week. I have ordered an online product as a last ditch remedy before I submit to ESWL.

I had a 5mm stone x-rayed and found lodged in my ureter on friday afternoon, Doc said it would not pass, so a removal procedure was set up for early monday morning. I found this site at about 10:00pm sunday night (2 hours before my food and drink cut-off of 12:00am). I drank 8oz. of lemon juice and two spoonfuls of canola oil (no olive in house). Pain was almost instantly gone. When I woke up next morning to go to removal procedure a little pain was felt and when Doc talked to me after procedure he couldn't understand where the stone went! I found this site a little late but foward this to friends. thankyou all..

I am a mother of 3 small children, and am also 7 mths pregnant, so the pain being dulled was huge for me! A BIG FAT YEA from me!!! I advice anyone to try this nasty mix! IT WORKS!!!!!!! I tried it again tonight, but the smell of the oil made me vomit it back up with my first swallow. Be sure and chase it down with some solid food, and at least 3 8oz glasses of water if your trying this. But WOW was it ever worth it!!!!! TY to everyone who posted this remedy!!!!! GOD BLESS!!!
5555	94	6523	Junk from Louisville, Ky	2009-09-29 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	A huge "YEA" to this remedy, 2 oz olive oil and 2 oz. lemon juice for Kidney Stones/Pain. If you are reading this try it, it works like a charm. I had kidney pain/stones and in severe pain for 3 weeks and was desperate, severe pain for three weeks. Although I completely doubted what the simple and safe olive oil and lemon juice mix could possibly have to do with your kidneys, with the many positive ratings I decided to try it. I drank about 1.5 oz. olive oil and 2 oz. of fresh lemon juice mixed, very important to "mix" so it wont taste too bad. Results: I felt a little nausea about an hour later. Then a strange creepy feeling in my gut about 3 hrs later, it felt like "Alien" in my kidneys, I even felt something moving in my good kidney on the other side. Then I had strange repeated urges to piss. I didn't piss a stone that I know of, but my chronic 3 weeks of severe kidney pain disappeared ! I could barely get out of bed the day before, and the next mourning was pain free ! Since I took only one dose and had "miraculous" results, I will definitely repeat in a day or two to finish the job. If you have pain anywhere near Kidneys, TRY THIS FIRST. It WORKS MAGIC ON KIDNEY STONES !!! It is basically salad dressing, how it has such an effect on your kidneys I don't know, but trust me it works ! Beats the heck out of paying the ER for painkillers and a surgery!
5556	94	6524	Emile from New York City, Ny	2009-09-12 00:00:00	BETTER BUT NOT CURED	2	0	So far so good... I've been struggling with a stone for the past two days now. Didn't want to admit it at first, too many bad memories of my agonizing trip to the ER 4 years ago. Soon though, the pain in my groin was accompanied by that familiar ache in my lower back...Panic set in. Dug around on the web for an hour or so before I found this site, (kept seeing sites that were CHARGING $$$ to give up their great kidney stone home remedies) and began to get discouraged, thinking I was in for another trip to the ER WITHOUT health insurance. This afternoon, before I even found this site I picked up a nice filet of Sole for dinner and ended up buying 7 lemons to cook it with! I had read about asparagus as a natural diuretic and also bought some rather dubious looking "kidney health" pills. Anyway, cooked the sole with lemon, white wine, shallots and butter, and ate a whole bunch of asparagus. Didn't help much, but then again I wasn't expecting miracles. Then, found thid site and decided I may as well cut up the remaining 4 lemons and drink it down with some EVOO. NASTY to drink, actually gagged a bit on the EVOO, (didn't really measure, just dumped in a shot glass or so)...laid down and tried to read, felt a little bit of stirring in kidneys groin...about 30 minutes later had a massive pee, and no pain at all!

Due to a job change and some paper work mix up he is temporarily (we hope) without health insurance and I think he would be close to death before he would get medical attention. Anyway, I discovered your web site and encouraged him to try the lemon juice/olive oil remedy. He took two ounces of lemon juice with two ounces of olive oil two or three times about eight hours apart. About 24 hours after the first dose something changed a bit and although there was still pain, he was able to urinate more freely. After two days, he could tell that the stone had moved a couple inches and on the third day he passed the stone without further pain. Of course we are not completely sure that this was the result of the remedy, but I will surely try it myself if the need arises. Myself and three chidren have all had kidney stones in the past and had them removed by doctors. Those removal procedures were very painful themselves and I will avoid them if possible
5560	94	6528	Crissi from Dalls, Tx	2009-08-09 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I used the lemon juice/olive oil remedy for kidney stones. An hour or so after the pain set in I drank a mixture of 1/4 cup Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil and cheap lemon juice concentrate (the kind tht comes in the plastic bottle shaped like a lemon). I had to add 1/4 cup of orange juice to balance the acidity (it was too much even with my nose plugged) and 2 ice cubes because the lukewarm temperature was distasteful to me. I followed this with about 16 ounces of purified water (reverse osmosis). The pain resumed. About 2 hours later I did the "bump exercise" from this website. http://www.jumpandbump.com/ I followed the directions and after about the 10th set of "bumps" I immediately felt relief and the urge to urinate. I passed a small, soft, almost mucousy mass about the size of an eraser and then more smaller pieces the next time I urinated. I have felt perfectly normal since. I think that maybe the oo/lemon juice mixture worked on breaking down the stone and then the exercise helped move it down more quickly? I don't know for sure but I felt like I was in active labor, with pain wrapping from my kidney to my abdomen and within hours of ingesting the remedy and moments of completing the instructions on the previously mentioned website I was finally able to release a respectable amount of pee and have felt perfectly normal ever since!!!

5562	94	6530	JJS from Walla Walla, Wa	2009-07-24 00:00:00	BETTER BUT NOT CURED	2	0	My wife started to have exscrutiating pains and having gone the the hospital for a severe UTI ten days earlier just to have the same terrible reoccurring pains after finishing her anti biotic. Second trip to the ER and an appointment with a urologist later it was determined by a ct scan that a 5mm stone was making its way down the left uteror. Was prescribed Flowmax and still had hydrocodone from the uti. The hydrocodone did little to nothing for this pain, she was writhing and pacing our hall for relief, it was abundantly clear further doctors visits wouldn't yield anything but a pat on the head and a hope it will pass in time. There had to be relief somewhere, found this site and the ingenious feedback for different tinctures and remedy's. this being day 5 of this fiasco I am happy to report that taking 2oz lemon juice concentrate and 2 oz Extra Virgin Olive Oil with nose pinched has stopped her pain completely. She did throw up the contents of her stomach... We tried coke, Heineken, watermelon, tonnes of water, but it ended up with her vomiting cause the pain wouldn't subside. Just to be safe after throwing up I gave her an table spoon of lemon juice concentrate on her emptied stomach and since she kept that down for an hour loaded her into a hot bathtub and gave her a pain pill. The pain pill relaxed her enough to sleep in the tub for awhile but... this was about hour three since taking the tincture and an hour after vomiting, the contents didn't look oily oddly enough it looks as if she absorbed enough of the lemon juice to do the magic as this morning shes utterly pain free... just tired. Gave her a shot glass of the tincture (1 oz each) shes kept it down, which is easier today since theres no pain (duh) lol. So far. So good. Hoping to see the stone very soon but the RELIEF she experienced this morning is the first relief in days and if your going crazy with this sort of pain do anything.. ANYTHING to take this and keep it down and get comfortable.

5565	94	6533	Gail from Pottersville, NJ	2009-07-05 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Olive Oil & Lemon Juice for kidney stones: A resounding Yea for this remedy. I woke up early 4th of July morning with excruciating pain in my right side and my back. I knew it was a kidney stone passing because I had them twice before. Waited until 6am to wake my husband up and take me to the ER. They took CT scan and confirmed 3mm kidney stone at the edge of my bladder (and another one in the kidney). They gave me IV pain meds in the ER and Flomax to open the uriter (tube leading into bladder). They gave me a prescription for oxycodone for pain. When I went home I waited until 3pm to take the oxy. but mistakenly took the Flomax again (its supposed to be only once a day). Realized this at 4pm when the pain was not subsiding at all. Took the oxycodone but then went to the web to see if there was anything I could take to help this all along as long as I had overmedicated on the Flomax. I saw the olive oil and lemon juice and decided to try it. My husband mixed 2 oz. light olive oil (not EVOO) with 2 oz. freshly-squeezed lemon juice and put it in a small jar. That was good so I could remix it before I took each sip. Finished that (held my breath while drinking) and then drank 10 oz. of purified bottled water (which I got from a health food store). I laid down and went to sleep until 6pm. I woke up, went downstairs, smiled at my husband for the first time since this episode started and then had a sudden urge to urinate. I saved my urine so I could strain it. It came out really fast, hard and a lot (not like the little bits from earlier in the day). When I strained it, lo and behold my kidney stone was in the bottom of the strainer. Oh happy day!! So bottom line, it took 1 1/2 hours to pass the stone after drinking the olive oil and lemon juice. Now keep in mind, the stone was just at the edge of the bladder so all it needed was a "push." I firmly believe this remedy is what did that. This is my third stone. The first one passed in about 5 hours and the second one took 5 days. So all in all, this one passed pretty quickly. P.S. The stone was the size of a beebee and had a pointy hook on it. Big yea for this remedy. Thank you all. I will definitely use this when the next one pops out (ugh!)

5567	94	6535	Sangeetha from Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands	2009-06-24 00:00:00	NAY	1	0	I have a 4.8 mm kidney stone stuck in my kidney for the last 18 months. It doesn't cause pain, but causes discomfort. Lemon juice and olive oil remedy (about 8 dosages) didn't get it out. I am wondering if it is not calcium oxlate stone, but it could be struvite stone? I haven't had an UTI infection, so not sure if my stone could be struvite. However, I read that to dissolve the struvite stones, the urine has to be acidified. Does anyone know if lemon juice acidifies the urine? Same with ACV? Thanks for any input.
5568	94	6536	Jerry from Grand Rapids, Michigan	2009-06-23 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	YEA, it works!!!! I've been in constant pain for 2 weeks, w/ one trip to the ER as I couldn't keep anything down, Not even pain killers. I've been scared that it was too big to pass, as I was told it is 3 cm, about 1". Called today and found it's 3 mm, about 1/8". Nurse had "misspoke" the size while reading the CT report. So I tried to pass/dissolve w/ this formula. I started at midnight as I could take the pain no longer.
5569	94	6537	Emmbrooke from Cartersville, Georgia	2009-06-19 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I am 25 and have had kidney stones since I was 18. I recently had a urinary tract infection for which I was taking antibiotics. Well, a week after I was done with the medicine, I felt some similar symptoms coming back. I thought it was just another UTI. The next day I started having pain in my lower back on the left side. Of course, having kidney stones, I knew what was to come. I had lost my job the week earlier, thinking my insurance had been cancelled, I went online to see if there was a home remedy I could try. Then, I found this website. Of course, I was thinking there was no way this could work, but after reading one success story after another, I thought I would at least give it a try. I mixed 2 oz of lemon juice with 2 oz of extra virgin olive oil together with a wisk, then poured it into a shot glass so it would be easier to drink. I had to hold my nose to drink it, and the after taste was horrible. I didn't have a stomach ache like a lot of people had said. I continued to have some slight pain in my back. I took some ibuprofen and that helped while I was waiting (and hoping) for the lemon juice to work it's magic. That was 2 days ago. This morning I woke up, feeling much better than I have in the past couple of days. I went to the bathroom for my morning pee, but it was just normal. About an hour later, I was taking a shower and washing the privates, and felt something rolling around.(I know it sounds gross) I looked at it and it looked like a little brown stone. I made sure to save it, and after I got out of the shower and got online to see what they actually looked like. I had never actually seen the ones I pased before. It looked exactly like the pictures. I am a firm believer that the lemon juice and olive oil worked for me. I will deffinetely be using this from now on. I still had a small bit of pain, but nothing like what is usually accompanied by the passing of a kidney stone. This really does work, I am so glad I found this site.

5571	94	6539	S. Lewis from Oakley, CA	2009-06-06 00:00:00	BETTER BUT WITH SIDE EFFECTS	4	0	Hi- I'd like to give a "Yeah" on this 2 oz. lemon juice and 2 oz.olive oil thing with a severe caution and possible correction. I was past 48 hours of a horrible kidney stone case and so I found this home remedy on the 3rd evening. As soon as I mixed 4 ounce mixture and drank it I felt really 'full'. Later it became kind of gaseous and horrible and after 1 or 1 1/2 hrs I deliberately 'expelled' the rest of this heavy mixture. The "Yeah" part is that the next morning when I woke up the kidney stone was gone, thank goodness!! But, I was left with 2 days of the worst stomach you could possibly imagine and 'expelled' more of this heavy mixture here and there on it's own. So how about backing off to 1 or 2 TBS of each, instead of oz? Please be careful as the remedy was just about as bad as the condition and I felt it my deed to warn you as I wouldn't wish as stomach ache like this on my worst enemy, if I had one!

I followed her insistance and choked down the mixture and I am extremely happy I followed her advice. I was diagnosed through CT scan and ultrasouncd to have a 6 mm stone in my bladder, that had been causing pain for five days. I was perscribed Demerol and Flomax and told there was nothing else to do but wait it out!! After mixing 2 ounces of real lemon juice and 2 ounces of extra virgin olive oil, I drank that, followed by an eight ounce glass of water. I followed that over the next day with lemon drinks of 2 ounces of real lemon in 8 ounces of water. Within 24 hours, I was able to pass the stone with no discomfort at all.

Drinking a lot of water or cranberry juice in the past did nothing but make more pain and pressure. This worked great...I took some every 2 hours or so and passed several stones. The only warning is not to use extra virgin olive oil...I ran out of the other and tried that. I couldn't hardly swallow it. So, be sure to use regular olive oil.

When I notice the discharge from my nose is getting thick, yellow/green then I start drinking ACV. I put 1 tablespoon ACV into 12 oz. water. I drink the mix twice a day by straw to avoid getting the acid on my teeth (and I do not care for the taste). After a week, my sinus'are clear again. Dietary changes have helped me prevent the infections (and head aches).
5575	94	6543	Mary from San Jose, CA	2009-04-12 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Big Yay, here :) On 4/8/09 my husband began experiencing pain on his left side, the whole family had colds,so I didn't pay much attention to him. It was severe on 4/9/09 and I told him to go to the Doctor's, but like many men would not. On 4/10/09 he was convinced he was dying, but still refused to go to the doctor...thankfully I was feeling better and started an internet search. After having him describe the pain and asking him questions, I felt pretty confident it was kidney stones. I had to practically force the mixture (2 oz of lemon juice and 2 oz EVOO, mixed in some lemonade) down him. He took the mixture at 6:00 PM, I had him drink 2 big glasses of water, 1 glass of apple juice and 1 glass of cranberry juice,by 9:00 PM he was feeling significant relief, I gave him 2 oz of lemon juice in another glass of lemonade and he went to sleep. When he woke the next morning, 4/11/09, he was not back to 100%, but he was much improved. I gave him one more 2 oz lemon juice and 2 oz EVOO, by 10:00 he was laughing and joking. He sent me on my way to go do some errands...I came home to a sparkling clean house (he never cleans)! He said, he just felt so amazing and renewed he started cleaning and kept going. During the day he continued to drink water, apple juice and cranberry juice. Today, 4/12/09, he did one more juive/EVOO to be sure, but says he feels back to normal. He never saw a stone pass, but did say yesterday he could feel it moving, so not sure if still needs to pass or it just dissolved, but you have 2 more strong believers here...thanks so much for this site :)

I am 30 and have dealt with stones since the age of 17.A few days ago, I got that all too familiar feeling in my lower back and I knew what was coming. At midnight that night I mixed 2 ounces of each and guzzled it. About 30 minutes later I felt sick to my stomach and went to bed. The next day I had no more back pain (or nausea) and passed my stone with NO pain! As a matter of fact, I wouldn't have even known it came out if I hadn't seen it in the toilet. This worked wonders for me and I hope it helps other kidney stone victims as well. Good luck to all!

Have been getting ultrasounds every six months and in December one reported a 6mm stone at the exit of the right kidney. Urologist said it was not in a good position to do EWSL at that size and suggested surgery. I said maybe it will pass - he didn't think so - or maybe it will get big enough to do EWSL. I suggested a CT scan to get a more accurate picture in a couple of months, which he agreed to. For the next two months I did the 2oz olive oil + 2oz lemon juice a couple of times a week. Never had any pain, never had any blood in urine, so assumed the stone was still there. CT scan in February - stone was gone. Urologist was very surprised. I use a small electric stirrer to blend the olive oil and lemon juice together, helps with the taste.

We found your site and decided to try it. We used 2 oz olive oil and 2 oz of lemon juice. She wasn't happy about the taste, but was in so much pain, she drank it. After 1 'cocktail', she said she felt something moving. She passed a stone estimated 2 mm about 5 hours later. We continued this for a total of 3 cocktails and finally passed the last stone slightly larger than the last, approx 3 mm. We don't have scientific proof this works, but she recommends this to her friends and family now. We believe in this and hope others research alternatives to pain and surgery.
5580	94	6548	Bill from Staten Island, NY	2009-03-16 00:00:00	BETTER BUT NOT CURED	2	0	Lemon Juice & Olive Oil Remedy- I had read some weeks ago about this remedy. I was searching because I had verified the fact( w/ CT scan) that I had FIVE stones in my right kidney all about 3mm in size. This is my fourth episode with stones over about 15 years, two years ago having a stone about 1/2 inch. It required laser Litroscopy treatment and follow-up. I liked what I had read on this site and decided to give it a try. Over the course of eight days (taking 2oz.oil & 2oz.lemon juice) once each day, I am convinced I had passed at least one and maybe two stones. ( just going by the complete abscence of pain). After what I believe was a positive result, I am trying again to remove the remaining stones if possible. With that, I had taken a "cocktail" yesterday, and late in the afternoon at work I started having significant pain in the typical back area, radiating around front and low into the abdomen. I started taking a volume of water until I could get home for more oil and lemon juice. Here I sit and hope that I will pass this stone sometime between now and tomorrow. The pain associated with these stones has been something I would call "manageable". They are only 3mm size, and I am assuming the oil and juice might be reducing them thus cutting the pain quite a bit. I can remember the pain, nausea and dizziness associated with these things in the past. I am wondering though what the effect of ingesting all this oil and lemon juice might do? I'd be interested in anyone having an opinion on that! Thanks and good luck.

So I believe that one dissolved.

A few years ago, I was in a car accident and had some pretty nasty lower back pains. While I don't think the two we're related...the x-rays showed I had a pretty good sized stone(I think it was 8mm) I had lithotripsy done and never really felt 100%. On and off through the years... I'd get pain. Earlier this year, I could not believe the pain I had. I left my job and drove myself to the E.R. Sure enough, I had blood in my urine and a stone was trying to pass. Hard to believe in three years time a 7mm stone re-formed. Needless to say, in the following days, I drank water and even tried cranberry juice like mad. A few days went by(The Dr prescribed flo-max and I stayed home for a few days) and sure enough, I passed a stone while on the job pain free. It's now December and I've had a few pain free passings of these little buggers. Up until this morning. I think one is trying to get out, so I re-freshed this board, mixed up some olive oil and lemon juice (God that stuff tastes awful!) and downed it. Followed by three glasses of water. I'm keeping my fingers crossed it passes pain free. Thanks for sharing the info on this site!
5582	94	6550	Stan from Adelaide, South Australia	2009-03-08 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I am a person who was desperate as well, I had to have a week off work, when the attack came on. I was at home and quickly drove to the E.R just in time, with my wife, there I Vomited in the restroom right next to the waiting room. After hearing this for nearly 5 minutes, the Admin staff realized that it was serious and admitted me to intensive care. I was there for a whole day, on a Morphine drip and injections. After the pain had finally gone they told me to return for another scan.(I had the thing for nearly five days and its one of the most painful experiences Ive ever had,) In that time it returned nearly every night at 4.am, until I took some medication for it. It was recorded by Ultrasound as an 8mm calculus calcium based stone, stuck in the left kidney. They told me this will eventually lead to a urologist to contact me and make an appointment to work out an operating procedure. To cut a long story short, I had very little time to do something, quickly, in desperation I scurried through the web like there was no tomorrow, and I found the money grabbers etc, but then came upon your site, the words lemon etc suddenly appeared in front of me. After reading the testimonials, I thought why not give it a go, nothing could be worse than this even if spewing a few hours, I didn't care. I didn't have lemons, so I made some, using citric acid, put about quarter teaspoon in a small glass, with warm to hot water when nearly full, (holds about half can of coke) then for taste put about a tablespoon of Apple cider vinegar and honey, its easy to get from most supermarkets or health places.
5583	94	6551	Julia from Pittsburgh, PA	2009-03-08 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have had kidney stones about 5 times. They are horrible and I was hospitalized for them the first time I had them all they did was put me on pain killers. They worked to dull the pain but did not make them go away. I use the 2 ounces of olive oil and 2 ounces of fresh lemon juice mixed together and drink it down when I first feel them coming on. It worked, I have heard that the acidity in the lemon juice breaks the stones down and the olive oil helps them pass through your urethra easier. When you don't have health insurance you feel like you are helpless and will try any inexpensive remedy, and this worked for me. So give it a try you have nothing to lose but you kidney stones!
5584	94	6552	Bob from Vero Beach, FL	2009-03-08 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Yesterday my husband started having severe pain that he recognized as a kidney stone. Having experienced them several times in the past (most recently 2 years ago) he knew what he was in for. The last time he suffered most of the day before I took him to the ER. They gave him a morphine drip which he thought relaxed him enough to pass the stone. One other time he was in such severe pain for so long (2 or 3 days) and he tensed so much that he colapsed a lung. Not wanting to see that happen again, I took him to the ER. We have just recently moved to this area and had never been to this ER before. After waiting in agony for 1 1/2 hours, without even seeing the triage nurse, he felt the pain lessen and thought maybe he had passed the stone. We decided to go home and see. A short time after returning home, the pain started coming back. I decided to go online and investigate anything I could find. This site seemed to indicate that a lot of people had benefited from olive oil and lemon juice and it seemed harmless enough to try. I didn't see how it could hurt him. About 10 PM I mixed 2 oz of lemon juice (bottled) and 2 oz of extra virgin olive oil for him and he gulped it down. I can't say it tasted pleasant, but he can tolerate about anything. He drank about a gallon of water too. The pain didn't get any worse, and we both went to bed. In the morning he said he had urinated many times during the night and eventually the urine felt gritty and sandy. After that he felt much better. When he got up in the morning he felt GREAT! In fact he said he felt better than he had for a long time, so maybe the stone had been working on him for a while before the pain started. Of course we can't say with certainty that this remedy was the answer, but we can say that we will be trying it in the future, if it happens again. If so, we'll be sure to let everyone know. In any case, we are so greatful to the internet and to all of you who have taken the time to validate or dispute remedies you have tried. I don't know who in the heck ever thought up such a concoction, but we thank you so much!

Well, 2 of them were in my kidneys (both 3mm, and one in each kidney), and the other (5 mm) was in my bladder. Last night, I Googled natural remedies for the resolution of kidney stones, and came across the Lemon Juice and Olive Oil remedy. Honestly, I wasn't sure that something so simple would work, but I thought I'd give it a shot. So, last night at about 7pm, I mixed up the 2 ounces of extra-virgin olive oil, and 2 ounces of fresh lemon juice. It wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be....drinking straight olive oil. I just drank it as fast as I could! I didn't notice any change last night, except for some nausea. I also didn't notice anything today, until this afternoon, at about 3pm, when my left kidney started to throb. This went on for about 10 minutes, and after it subsided, I had the urge to go to the bathroom. Lo and behold, out came the stone! I didn't feel the stone passing, but for those of you out there who have passed stones before, you know when it happens. Anyway, all of this to say, THANK YOU to the poster of this remedy. It really and truly does work. I'm going to tell my Doc about it tomorrow, when I deliver my stone in a plastic baggy to him for evaluation. :) I'm surprised this remedy isn't more widely known and recognized?
5586	94	6554	GD from Libertyville, IL	2009-02-18 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Two Sundays ago I experienced tremendous lower back pain, thinking I pulled something. After suffering for two hours, I had my wife take me to Emergency. Once there, after only approx. 10 minutes in a bed and not yet being administered an IV, the pain went away. I was given a CAT scan where it was determined I had a 4mm stone halfway down the ureter on my lower left side. I left the hospital with two perscriptions - 600 mg Ibuprofen and Vicodin. I took these whenever I felt a flairup coming but it still took approx. 40 mins. for the pain to subside. I found this article, mixed up 3 ozs. of olive oil and 3 ozs. of lemon juice. I held my nose and chugged it this last Sat. afternoon. Sat nite was my last flairup. I have been totally pain free for 4 days now. I never felt the stone actually move or pass but wherever it is, I'm not in any pain. I just hope it passed - maybe it's hiding in my groin area or bladder? Regardless, this conconction, as nasty as it was, worked! I don't advise laying down after you swallow it like I did as it creeped back down my throat and left me with a nasty taste in my mouth. In hindsight, maybe only 2 ozs. of each would have been better?
5603	94	6571	Lisa from Woodbridge, VA	2008-11-05 00:00:00	NAY	1	0	This remedy was a BIG NAY for me unfortunately. I tried this every night for a week. As dreadful as it was, swallowing the oil, I thought anything was better than having surgery and stents again. I was even drinking an additional two oz. of lemon juice in the morning. I couldn't tell if I had any success or not until last night when after doing some heavy duty cleaning all day long a had blood in my urine again. That is how I discovered these five stones four weeks ago in the first place. My urologist is sending me to a specialist at Georgetown hospital because I just had three large stones removed a year ago. So this will be my fourth time with stones since 2001 and I really hoped that the lemon and oil was going to work for me but it just didn't. I thought it sounded to good to be true and perhaps it works for some people, just not me. : (

I had my share of going to ERs, taking medication, having all kinds of procedures (invasive and none invasive) done to relieve the terrible pain. I had one kidney stop working at one point because of a large 8mm stone. To make the long story short, I came across the olive oil and lemon juice mix by accident before finding this website when my little son's doctor told me to mix a tea spoon of lemon juice + tea spoon olive oil + tea spoon honey and give it to my son each morning to enhance his immune system (my son is almost 3 years old by the way). It seemed to work fine for my son so I started taking the same stuff, but with larger amounts. I used to get about one kidney stone every year or two, but after starting to drink the olive oil lemon juice mix, I had two stones in one month come down from my kidney to my ureter. I guess the mix helps clean the kidneys as well. Anyways, the first stone was relatively small (2-3mm) and I took the mix before I went to bed and at 4am in the morning it poped out. The next stone was 5mm and not as easy to get out. The Dr. at the ER said it may not come out on its own. I had to try the mix several times (8-10) before it finally worked. My advice to those trying this mix is: 1. Have patience. Dont give up if it does not work the first time you try the mix. Even if it does not come out, it will be moving and you will suffer less pain. 2. When you take the mix (about 2oz lemon juice + 2 oz olive oil), take it at night right before you go to bed and dont drink or eat anything after you take it. Let it sit in your stomach for the night. I found that I get better results that way. 3. The reason I know it works is that for the first time, I had the 5mm stone break into three pieces (two small ones and one big one) and all three poped out on the same day. Before the lemon+ olive mix, the stones never broke up to pieces. Anyways, I usually dont get involved in commenting on sites, but in this case Im hoping that this may help some poor soul out their suffering from this horrible pain. Best of luck to all and if it does not work the first time try, try, and try again.

It was nearly two years ago when I checked into the Emergency Room at 3:00am in excruciating pain. Unbeknownst to me, I was having my first encounter with a dreaded kidney stone and could only equate the pain to child birth. I had it pretty bad, bloody urine samples,sweating, and uncontollable vomiting, only to find out that the stone was impacted at the top of my bladder and would require surgery to remove it. After the doctor removed the stone a stent was inserted. Thank Heaven I was sedated for this. A week later the doctor removed the stent in his office (no sedation) BIG OUCH!! I nearly passed out from the pain. The doctor was very vague on what my diet should consist of. He just wanted to see me in 2weeks for aurine sample, then 3 months for a urine sample, then 6 months for a urine sample, yet he still didn't have any specifics. I started to feel like just a payday to him. Well, I swore I would do ANYTHING to prevent this from ever happening again, and if you ever had a stone, please understand you will be more prone to them than a person who has never had one. Approximately one year later I recognized that all too familiar pain in my back. Without hesitation, I consumed the Olive Oil/Lemon Juice mixture and by the next morning I had noticeable gravel in my urine and best of all NO PAIN! Now I always keep fresh lemons on hand just in case and I'm left wondering what my outcome would have been two years ago had I known about this awesome remedy. Wishing you all Best of Health.
5589	94	6557	Marcus  from Vancouver, BC	2009-01-26 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	A couple days ago I tried the lemon juice and olive oil cure. Initially I was skeptical... and my mom the nurse told me that all of these little home fixer-uper's don't do the trick. We I gave it a shot... I mean why the heck not. The day after taking a nice half glass of olive oil and a chaser of lemon juice I felt pretty rotten... but I could feel it move. No not that... the kidney stone! I did have a belly ache from hell for that day.... but there was motion in the ocean. Today i'm glad to say that i've given birth to a nice little stone. Not sure what to name the little guy yet... I am however taking suggestions. Thanks earth clinic... you've been a great help! marcus
5590	94	6558	Diana from Sebring, Florida	2009-01-21 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I suffered from a Kidney stone for 20 days, I went to the hospital on January 1st and I thought I had passed it about three days later because the pain went away but about a week later the pain came back and remained for two weeks straight except it was further down in my bladder and groin area. I was in misery, I didn't know what to do. I didn't want surgery, and I still had another two weeks for my dr. appt. to the Urologist and I didn't want to go back up to the Emergency room so.. I tried the 2 onces of Olive Oil and 2 onces of lemon Juice, with a glass of water, of course it isn't pleasant to drink, but if you hold your breathe and drink it fast, you can drink it down fast.... it was amazing for me... I took it at about 11pm and passed my stone by 5am in the morning. My stone was already in my bladder so it was ready to come out so I am sure that was why it was so fast. But I am so relieved to get it out. I didn't want to suffer any more.... Thanks to the people who put this cure out there..

The night before I tried the cure I was feeling very uncomfortable (aching kidney, nausea, constant need to go to the washroom and stress as I was sure that I would spend the next day at the hospital). I decided to try the cure first. I felt almost immediate relief. My kidney had been mildly aching for 5 days and it stopped. I haven't had any pain since!!

5593	94	6561	A. from Springfield, IL, USA	2009-01-12 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I recently tried the olive oil and lemon juice remedy for kidney stones and it worked for me. I was diagnosed with a 5-6mm stone three weeks ago. I was told that it was too big to pass and that I should have surgery to have a stint put in. I am currently pregnant which limited my options of removal. I opted to cancel the surgery since I was in no pain and try a more natural method. For the first two weeks I drank the 2 oz. olive oil and 2 oz. lemon juice 3 times a day along with a lot of distilled water. I also tried the asparagus mixed with the olive oil and lemon juice and the 4 oz. apple cider vinegar remedy. I only continued with the 2 oz. lemon juice and 2 oz. olive oil for the entire time though. The last week I just drank the 2 oz. of lemon juice and 2 oz. of olive oil at night followed by a large glass of warm water. Finally three weeks later I passed the stone pain free, 2mm smaller (and rounded) than what the doctor had told me it was going to be.

5596	94	6564	Joanna from Santa Fe , New Mexico	2008-12-14 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Kideny stones/kidney debris. The lemon juice (2 oz), olive oil (2 Tbsp,) and Stone Free from Planetary Herbals, Michael Tierra (5 the first 3 days, 4 times a day; now 3 tablets 3 times a day with the lemon juice and oil) has changed my life. The back pain I had put off to my scoliosis, and the groin pain from sitting for college classes, however, when they both came on together and persisted for 6 weeks my daily life became really overwhelming. I got relief from both within 36 hours from the above combination. Now, 2 weeks later I get twinges in my back and groin but water keeps the above combination keeps pain from returning. However, in continuing with the lemon juice, olive oil, Stone free, physical activity and hot baths I realize had this condition for a long time. I think I have had blockage in my bladder (the groin pain) from having a seven year bout with food poisoning and just plain lowered functioning kidneys from my scoliosis. These last two weeks have removed the acute pain and although I still have a dull ache especially in the morning, I am going to keep this in my daily/weekly regime. I am sleeping better and am way more relaxed. Thank you for your web site as I had spent several hundred dollars with X-rays (that showed nothing), body work, PT, and even seeing an orthopedic surgeon. I love natural healing.

I have had pain in my middle left back for weeks and was growing very concerned. In surfing the web, I found this sight and read about the Olive Oil and Lemon Juice remeday. Bottom line, my pain is GONE. I took two ounces of fresh lemon juice and two ounces of raw olive oil twice a day. One in the AM and one in the PM. Day one I feld absolutely no relief. Day two, no realief what so ever. Day three, I woke up and was very amazed that I had no pain. I drank my "cocktail" and got on with my day. No pain all day. WOW. So here I am in day four feeling great with no pain at all. I so very happy I found this sight and I have very little doubt that this remeday worked for me.
5598	94	6566	Darryl from Hamilton, New Zealand	2008-12-13 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have had kidney stones 2 times before, and when i started feeling the symptoms again, I knew I was in for it. To cut a long story short, after being hospitalized and having a CT scan, they found a 2mm stone. Doctors said that it will pass naturally and theres nothing natural or medical that they can do. So I went home in great discomfort with a prescription for pain relief and went searching for natural remedies on the net and came across the olive oil and lemon treatment (about 3oz of each). I was a bit skeptical, but I mixed the two ingredients, swallowed it followedd by a large glass of purified water and within 4 hours,I passed the stone through painlessly (although I couldnt see it in the toilet bowl, I knew it had passed), and my aches and pains have gone (although I seem to be sleeping alot). My stools are a little soft, but I took another dose this morning just to be sure theres nothing left in my kidneys, and will probably take it every 6 months or so, just to keep on top of it. Cant believe Doctors cant recommend this treatment. Thank you.
5599	94	6567	Darryl from Chicago, IL	2008-12-09 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I just went through my 4th bout of kidney stones in 30 years. I went into the emergency room one week ago where they CT scanned a 4mm stone. After the usual morphine and begging to go home since I knew they couldn't do much for me there other than load me up with morphine for the pain, I was released. 6 days and no stone. 3 more days until surgery is scheduled to pull it out. My wife ran across this site and immediately ran out and got fresh lemons and olive oil. She made me the shooter of 2 oz. of each mixed together and I chased it with water. At 11:30 the following morning I passed the stone. A mere 16 hours after trying the remedy. After 6 days of usual fluid loading, all it took was this remedy. I am an old pro at kidney stones, but this one taught me something new. Thanx for the remedy and I would highly suggest it to anyone suffering the agony of kidney stones. The taste of this is nothing compared to the pain.
5600	94	6568	Tim Calvert from Portland, Oregon	2008-11-26 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have had kidney stones for 15 years, a bad episode every 2 to 5 years. I was delighted to find this web site and immediately took both vinegar and lemon juice and olive oil in 2 oz portions. I took more lemon juice and olive oil subsequently, today I passed a stone, very little discomfort. I am angry at the mainstream medical profession that seems unwilling to toss out some of these safe, inexpensive and effective treatments.

5602	94	6570	Jeff from Tallahassee, FL	2008-11-10 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Last Friday around 3 PM I got a sharp pain in my side that rapidly got worse and worse. I tried going to the bathroom, sitting in a hot bath, sleeping it off, but nothing worked. I came downstairs and my wife said I was white as a ghost and that we should go to the ER. They diagnosed it as a kidney stone, gave me some pain pills, and sent me home. For the next three days, the pain stayed in the exact same spot, and I was worried and had no answers as to what to do. My wife found this website with this lemon juice and olive oil remedy. I took my first serving (2 oz lemon juice, 2 oz olive oil) followed by a glass of water this morning. A few hours later, the sharp pains returned but this time felt like they were in a different spot. I took a pain pill, went to bed, woke up and the pain had gone away. Later that afternoon, I had my second dose of lemon juice and olive oil. About an hour later, I felt a bit nauseous and had some pain in my groin area. I went to the bathroom, and to my amazement, peed out a BB sized kidney stone, with no pain. I've never felt the pain of a kidney stone before and I hope to never feel it again. I know the stone may have been ready to come out on its own, but I really feel like it was this remedy that made it happen so quickly and painlessly. The stone hadn't budged for days, until the day I started taking the lemon juice and olive oil. Thanks so much to whoever discovered this, because it worked awesomely.
5604	94	6572	Roland from Manchester, NH	2008-10-23 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Had my first stone moving last weekend and it lodged in the ureter at the top of my bladder. Customary pain set in Monday AM, visited docs, had CT scan which showed a 5-6mm stone. Found this site Monday, picked up loads of lemons at store and did 2-3 oz. fresh squeezed lemon mixed with 2-3 oz. organic extra virgin olive oil and chased it with a large tumbler of water - 3x on Monday, 2x on Tuesday and Wed. (morn. and eve) and this AM and sent the little bugger on its way about an hour ago. This combined with LOTS of water (as usual) probably did the trick. Yesterday, the Urologist told me they'd probably need to go in and get this one out due to the size and inflammation around it, but they wanted to give Flomax a try. Never used the Flomax. Took some Advil to help reduce any swelling, then lots of water with this remedy. It's all good stuff and certainly can't hurt. I have another that showed up on the CT that will fall at some point - and I'll be back to lemon juice and EVOO!!!
5605	94	6573	O. from Arlington, Texas	2008-10-07 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Tried the lemon juice and olive oil for kidney stones. 2oz each twice per day for 2 days. I also sipped on natural lemon juice, grape cranberry juice and distilled water for a week. I rubbed oregano oil on my side to relieve the inflamation. Pain subsided immediately. Never witnessed the passing of the stone. I think the lemon juice dissolved it and the oil perhaps created ease of movement. There has been no pain for nearly a month. Hallejah!

Found this site and all your positive comments re lemon juice and extra virgin olive oil. Within 24 hours pain reduced by 50% and 24 hours later passed a stone with ''really'' jagged edges. Thank you so much for sharing, it really proves we can help each other as any pain is needless if it can be avoided by shared intelligence. Thanks again. Barry

It has at least made my ongoing episode a little more tolerable... I started with minor back discomfort about two months ago which grew into a visit to my local E.R. Severe flank pain, chills, and profuse sweating came over me. No family or neighbors were around that Sunday so I called 911 which I never though I would have to do. After a brief ten minute transport my pain was close to unbearable as I found myself asking for painkillers. Of course I had to be registered and interviewed and promised the doctor would see me as soon as he could. I did my best to try and not look like a junky. The E.R. was a bit busy but my pain didnt care. I told them I was nauseas they told me to be patient. The only satisfaction I got that day was five minutes later throwing up on the aquarium in the waiting room which to me was like a big 'I told you so'. Well they wheeled me into my little E.R. space then I explained that I thought I had a kidney stone because of a similar incident about 16 yrs earlier. Also my parents have a history of kidney stones. (and all the other severe symptoms at that time).
5608	94	6576	Eric from Grand Rapids, Michigan - USA	2008-09-29 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have been suffering from kidney stones for the past 5 years, and have had laser and basket surgury 2x to remove these painful stones. I had surgury three months ago, and it took me a month to recover having gotten sick from the medications, had awful pain from placing and removing my uretal stints, and having an internal catheter placed in my because ... well, I couldn't pee. One month following the surgury, I found another stone had dislodged itself from my other kidney and it would not come out for two months. I was scheduled for surgury this Thursday(another laser and basket), and was willing to try anything not to go through that recovery again. I had been drinking lemon juice in water for a couple weeks, but after finding this site, I tried the 2oz olive oil and 2oz lemon juice. I did this two times in one day. No results. I waited a couple of days. Still nothing. I chalked it up to another unproven folk-remedy and prepared for surgury. On Saturday, I thought that I would try it one more time, this time trying 3oz olive oil and 3oz lemon juice. It tasted so disgusting I thought I was going to vomit. A couple of hours later, I felt sick to my stomach all day. I thought it was from drinking so much oil. I now think that this was because of my kidney stone moving. Just before midnight I woke up to use the bathroom and passed a huge, twisted stone shaped like the letter J with a point on one end and a jagged chisel shaped shaft. It was about 5mm (the CAT scan had said it was 3.6mm) There was another 2mm stone that came out as well. No blood. Still felt nauseated until the next morning, but I avoided surgury and am so glad.
5609	94	6577	Greg from Alameda, California	2008-09-29 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	After reading the comments from this post, I thought that the idea of drinking olive oil and lemon juice for kidney stone removal was totally absurd. I had a pain on my right-side and visited a urologist who told me that I had a kidney stone at 6.5 mm in size, and he prescribed for me Flomax, Norco, and a diuretic to rid the stone. After usuing the Flomax for one day, I had major side effects and problems due to this drug, so I abandoned it and proceeded with the natural way. At first I was reluctant to try this method and I emailed a user from this post who told me exactually what to do and expect. So I did it. I mixed 2 ounces of olive-oil and 2 ounces of refridgerated fresh squeezed lemon juice, twice daily in the morning and at night, and to my surprise!!! on the 5th day, I urinated that stone and a bunch of gravel...... NO PAIN!! I am totally convinced and will always use this method to get rid of kidney stones. I would like to thank all of the people who posted this remedy and to the website EarthClinic who made this possible for me.
5610	94	6578	Sophie from Quebec, Canada	2008-09-24 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I had a 5 mm kidney stone for over 5 years. I took 2 oz lemon juice + 2 oz olive oil one time in the morning and one time at evening for two days. - I felt pain for a couple days enough to go at the hospital and the tests showed that the kidney stone is gone.

But the pain of bladder stones during urination was too much. But before i went to the doctor i found this site and this remedy. i took 2 ounces each of lemon juice from concentrate and olive oil. i did it every few days for about a week and a half. then i waited months to respond to this site. the pain was gone immediately and after 9 days i didn't get a return of pain during urination. yes i knew for a fact it was not VD or any other issue like that...

Then I find this website, thank God. I mixed up olive oil and lemon juice. Dink that up followed by a large amount of water. After 2 hours I have pop out first stone but pain continues. Tomorrow morning second stone drops out without any pain in the penis and no more pain was presented from that point on. So this is definitely yes for me and I will use this method first if this happen again.
5613	94	6581	Dale Reed from McAllen, TX	2008-09-11 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Thankfully to God and this site my vote is a 'yea'. Here is my story -- It started with severe pain in my side one morning (on 7/1/08). Actually I believe it all started months before that with my drinking too many sodas and not enough water each day. When the pain began I had no idea what was causing it. All I knew was that I needed to get to a hospital ASAP. A friend drove me to one and upon arrival I was given a morphine transfusion for pain. After x-rays and two (unnecessary and very expensive) cat scans I was told that I had a five mil. stone in one of my ureters. I say unnecessary because I believe the x-rays would have been sufficient. I was then prescribed two oral pain medicines and told that I needed to see an urologist. The severe pain returned the next morning and dissipated after taking the meds. This occurred again for the next two days. That's when I began my internet search for a possible cure for the stone and came upon this site. I decided to drink three ounces of lemon juice and three ounces of extra virgin olive oil instead of two ounces of each because I am a bigger person than average and also so that I could be more certain that it would work. I drank this two times a day (morning and evening) for three days followed each time with about 12 ounces of water. The taste of the concoction was terrible but made more bearable by drinking a very small amount of V-8 juice immediately after each dose and before drinking the glass of water. I have had no more pain after taking my first dose and I never saw a stone pass (or any blood). I believe the stone was dissolved by the acid from the lemon juice. Again, thank God it worked for me. It's too bad I didn't take this remedy before my visit to the hospital. I now have a bill from the hospital for $7,316.20 and a bill from the attending doctor for $931. People really need to know about this treatment in order to avoid a lot of pain and unnecessary expenses.
5614	94	6582	Keith from Tampa, FL	2008-08-30 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	After passing a kidney stone 15 yrs ago, I thought I'd never get one again. 10 days ago I had right=sided back pain that radiated to my right lower abdomen. I urinated blood tinged urine for 2 days then after my excruciating 2 hrs of pain (labor-pain) I passed a 3 mm stone. A week later the bloody urine started again with moderate discomfort in my low-back and abdomen. i thought "not another one!". this discomfort went on for 2 days while at work. I'm a nurse that works in the emergency room and took care of 2 patients passing stones during my uncomfortable ordeal. I found this website last night and decided to try 2oz lemon juice and 2oz of olive oil while continuing my fluid intake(cranberry/water). This morning I mixed just the lemon juice 2oz and a quart of water, and 2 hrs later gave birth to a hideous 5mm stone. Although I am a nurse I believe I would have wasted my time going to the emergency room. Thanks !
5615	94	6583	Seaside Andy from Panama City, FL	2008-08-26 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I am very cynical and was doubtful. However, when you actually get the results that I have read about in these posts, it's very compelling so I am glad I tried it. 3AM Monday morning awoke to find I was peeing what looked like cherry kool aid. 6 mos earlier I had a stone that gave me the chills, back ache pains fever, etc. So I figured I was in for this again with the peeing blood. Went online and found your site. I gathered all the necessary items to perform an oil/lemon, celery tea and coke/asparagus mix. I wanted to do the coke thing as a last resort. I hate the thought of drinking that much liquid crap in 2hours time. So at 7:30am I took 4oz Olive Oil/4 oz Lemon Juice (fresh squeezed). At 9:00 am drank celery seed tea (1 teaspoon celery seeds and 1 cup water - boiled let cool, then chug). 10 am another 1 cup of celery seed tea. By Noon that day the urine resembled urine and not red wine. Also I could "feel" the stone moving as the pain in my back was releived within an hour of drinking the oil/juice. The pain was pretty much non existant by 2pm. At 2pm took another 4oz/4oz juice & oil. Oh, yeah - I drank about 1 1/2 gallons of distilled H20 between 8am - 3pm. So I went to bed at 11pm and kept "the jug" by the bedside. After having woke at 3am this morning - I am glad to say I passed about a 4mm stone. And as an added bonus, about 5 GALL stones in my stool! This concoction appearently helps get rid of gall stones too! - BTW I see a lot of comments regarding the taste. It does give a "kick" at first swallow, but I did not have any problems except initially feeling nauseated after drinking. After that nothing. So take from my post what you will. I am going to keep doing this for another few days to maybe release some straggler stones! - Good Luck and thanks for the info on this site!
5616	94	6584	PB from Austin, TX	2008-08-25 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I *can't* believe it! This actually worked, and like others on this site, I too am a skeptic. But I'm a skeptic with no health insurance, so after reading a BUNCH of stuff, I decided to try this. (I read about the Coke & Asparagus method also, but I didn't think I could handle that much Coke in 2 hours.) So after feeling pretty bad on Friday and Saturday, I spent all day Saturday doing my diagnosis and trying to find cheap home remedies, all on-line of course. Saturday night around 8 pm, I drank 2 oz. of pure, fresh lemon juice mixed with 2 oz. of extra virgin olive oil (cold pressed). Yeah, it's gross, but definitely do-able. Unlike others here, I did not experience any quick relief. In fact, I felt worse and thought I had perhaps misdiagnosed myself. But knowing that persistence can pay off, I got up Sunday morning and took another dose of 2 + 2 oz around 10 am. Again, gross. Again, I felt awful. I experienced a LOT of swelling in what I think is my gallbladder region - guess my gallbladder didn't like processing 2 big boluses of fat 14 hours apart. BUT, the payoff came Sunday night. I woke up a few times in the middle of the night and could tell I was feeling better. On Monday morning, I felt MUCH better. Not 100% mind you, but about 95% better than I had. Originally, I could tell the blockage was in my right ureter, but overnight on Sunday, I felt something moving in my left ureter as well. The swelling seems to be going down in my gallbladder, but I may go to an herbalist or get some acupuncture...anything to avoid a $15K MRI/lithotripsy/gallbladder removal procedure.... Thanks, Earth Clinic & other contributors!
5617	94	6585	Daniel from Los Angeles, California	2008-08-16 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I am 37 years old and bipolar. I never knew that I had a 'kidney stone' problem until recently. I have investigated anything that could be considered to be the cause or culprit to trigger my bipolar, and until recently, I thought I was incurable...I actually used to laugh at people that took so much time to respond to ads like this (like, 'what losers....'); but now I am one of them. I have had pains in my right side where my kidney was, but always attributed it to being dehydrated, or something I ate or just some kind of sprain. But then I wondered if I might have a kidney condition and none of my doctors would do any tests to find out. I began to lose faith in my doctors and western medicine altogether...I firmly believe that anyone who is diagnosed with a mental illness should consult a professional, but now I also suggest seeking alternative measures. Having considered my kidneys as part of my problem, I tried the olive oil and lemon juice (2oz. and 2oz. each), for about 3 days every 8 hours or so, and I started having spasms in my right kidney area almost immediately. After about 24 hours, I felt the 'tumbling' sensation in my bladder when I urinated. The second night I woke up in the middle of the night with shooting pains in my rectal area, which immediately subsided. The next morning I urinated and out came a few stones and I feel soooooo much better. I actually feel more 'clear headed' and not so pessimistic (if that's even possible...). I don't know if this is a cure for bipolar, but I SINCERELY believe that is has helped me immensely with my mental balance. Thank you for posting all of your supportive letters and Earth clinic for allowing us to post them here. God bless you!
5618	94	6586	Albert from Apple Valley, California	2008-08-08 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	INCREDIBLE!! I woke up at 11:00 pm in mild pain in my right flank/kidney area and within 5 minutes could not stand up straight, foolishly endured tremendous pain for 2 days then sought treatment, urgent care diagnosed kidney stone gave me pain killers told me to drink lots of water and it should pass. 4 days later absolutely no improvement and I intuitively felt this thing was stuck and was not going to pass, back to urgent care, then over to a CT scan results were 2 stones 7mm in the kidney doing virtually no harm and a 6mm stone stuck at the opening of the tube, the PA told me it probably won't pass and he made an appointment for me to see a urologist 2 days from then, the reality of some type of invasive procedure or sonic treatment was disturbing as I cannot afford to be off work another week or so, so I get online find this site, send my wife to the store for $10.00 worth of lemons. 1 whole lemon (about 2 oz.) and equal amt. of olive oil full dose taken twice the first 24 hours along with pain meds. Same doses 3 times the next 24 hours...somewhere in that 48 hours the stones were dissolved!!! I never even passed a stone!! thank you for this site!! had I followed traditional medicine it would have cost me thousands more in medical bills and lost income. Drs. promise to "do no harm"...why wasn't I told to take the pain med and this mixture and call them in 3 days, why...because they would lose thousands that's why.
5619	94	6587	Patrick from Yorktown, Va	2008-08-03 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	It really works! After 3 mornings of intense pain at home, I spent 4 hours in the Emergency Room last week screaming and convulsing in pain. A CT scan found a 2.5mm stone in my ureter. Although the doctor didn't recommend the home remedy of olive and lemon juice, I went home all doped up on morphine, vicodin, and toradol and tried it anyways. I mixed up 2 oz of oil and 2oz of the juice and drank it down. I did this a total of three times in about 8 hours. It has now been 4 days with no pain, and nothing has passed! No stones, nothing! I am sure the 6 ounces of juice completely destroyed the stone...it is gone. It really works.
5620	94	6588	Mack from Central Point, OR	2008-07-26 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Big thumbs up to the olive oil and lemon juice remedy for kidney stones. I feel really let down by western medicine, as upon my first stone early this week, they gave me a 50% chance of passing it and a 90% chance of success doing the recommended ultrasound shockwave procedure, which they described as a "minor" outpatient non-surgical remedy. Turns out, it costs $15k. Even with my insurance, the cost was too much, so I cancelled their surgery and found this website. I drank the oil and juice concoction each of four days, the last dose when I felt the 5 mm stone wanting to take its final stinging leg of its journey. To my surprise, it slid right out. I combined the juice and oil remedy with two sessions of acupunture, daily doses of milk of magnesia, and a hot pack on my kidney and bladder up until the last day. My doctors didn't bother to address the constipation and the stomach gas, both which had to improve before I saw any progress with the stone. They also didn't say anyhing about staying upright and active, about hot packs, about alternatives like the oil and juice, acupuncture, or the apple cider and water mix, which I also tried. They seemed happy to rush me into surgery. I say the oil and juice remedy is well worth the thousands in dollars of savings.
5621	94	6589	Stephen from Dallas, Texas	2008-07-17 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I went in to the emergency room on Friday morning July 11 with horrible lower left side back pain and was diagnosed with a 2-3mm kidney stone. I went through the weekend in indescribable pain. I found this website Tuesday and tried the lemon-olive oil mix and it almost immediately reduced and rid the pain for the remaining time. I took it three times since Tuesday and this morning (Thursday July 17th) finally passed the little monster. Too bad I didn't find this site on Friday! Thanks for the scoop!
5622	94	6590	Dan from St. Louis, Missouri	2008-07-14 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I've had kidney stones a number of times just in this year. I got them recently and was desperate for a quick fix, my girlfriend got online and found this one had good reviews from everyone and so I gave it a try. At the time i had drank about 15 bottles of water and still wasnt able to urinate. Not even a minute after trying this remedy I was able to go to the bathroom. I took the lemon juiceolive oil two more times the next day and I passed the stone that evening with remarkably less pain than usual.
5623	94	6591	Julie from Abingdon, Maryland	2008-07-10 00:00:00	BETTER BUT NOT CURED	2	0	My story so far is as follows. I never had kidney stones before, and realize now that I never did drink enough fluids daily. I was constantly deydrating myself, and will never do that again! Anyway, I went to the emergency room in excruciating pain on July 2nd, 2008. After the lovely and long wait, I got a CIT scan of my abdomen, etc. They said I had two 3mm in my ureta, and one 7mm in my right kidney. I then had what I call the "episode" on that next Sunday night, being in such pain I just did not think I could take it any longer. It is that bad! I finally got in to see the urologist on 7/9 and he said I would need to get the large 7mm ultrasound zapped (as I call it). I was sent home with Flomax, antibiotics (I developed a UTI which I also never had before), and instructions to get an Xray, and maybe in a few weeks I could get the zapping done. I was a bit discouraged with this whole thing, that there never seems to be any urgency on the medical establishment. We are all just supposed to suffer I guess for weeks until they can "fit us in". I am not picking on doctors, but it is frustrating. I started looking for natural ways to help with this, and found the lemon juice and olive oil idea. What I have been struggling with much more than the pain (which really only happend so far on the day I went to the emergency room and that next Sunday), is the urgency feeling of having to run to the bathroom all day. It is like a cramping, spasm kine of thing, and really puts a damper on the day! I took two lemon juice/olive oil treatments yesterday, and already this morning I have no urgency! Nothing passed yet, but I took another dose this morning, and will hopefully have some good effects as the others posted here have had! Thanks to all for the great advice!
5625	94	6593	David from chino hills, CA	2008-06-08 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I went to the ER Friday am and CT scan confirmed a 2MM stone. I was discharged with Tylenol with Codeine. I found the Earth Clinic website on Sunday. Tried the Lemon Juice and Olive Oil @ 10:AM and again around 1:00PM. Good News, 6:00PM, our pops the stone, very brown with rough edges, no pain, no blood, no hassle! Thanks Earth Clinic!
5626	94	6594	Alison from Windsor, CA	2008-05-27 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	On 5/26/08 I tried the Lemon Juice & Olive Oil Kidney Stone Remedy as a last resort and it actually worked! I was shocked. I drank the mix around 2:30pm and passed the stone at 9:32pm that same day. It did make me gag, but I was able to keep it down. My stone had been stuck in the urethra for just over 3 days and was 4mm.
5629	94	6597	Sean from Glenrock, WY	2008-05-09 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have to say that I have always regarded any kind of home cure mumbo jumbo as garbage. But 12 hours into crying and throwing up trying to pass a stone opens ones mind to trying about anything. I did the lemon juice and olive oil and it worked 2oz of each. tasted nasty but did the job. I was amazed. This was my 13th round with stones and i wished id of found it sooner. This stone was 5mm.
5630	94	6598	Kim from Chicago Area, IL	2008-04-30 00:00:00	BETTER BUT NOT CURED	2	0	I have been a chronic stone sufferer since I was 19 years old. I am now 31. This latest episode sent me to the ER which of course was pointless because they couldn't see anything on the CT scan and they promptly start treating you like you have a back sprain and you are just in there for the pain meds. ANYWAYS, this time I wanted to try something natural, and I tried the lemon juice/olive oil thing. 2 oz of each twice a day. This is my 3rd day, and my pain is sporadic at best now - definately less intense, and my urine stream is back to normal. I am going to continue drinking it for a couple of more days, but if it doesn't rid you of the stone, it sure makes you feel a whole lot better. I highly recommend this method, for at the very minimum - pain relief so you can function.
5631	94	6599	Rey from Jacksonville, FL	2008-04-14 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I was out of town in January and initially thoght I had a UTI due to the blood in my urine. But by the second sleepless night and increased pain in my lower back I realized I had a kidney stone. I'm not one for western medicine doctors since I learned through Wellness/Anti-Aging/Naturopathic practitioners how to get myself off of three blood pressure meds and glucophage (diabetes), I turned to the interent to solve my dilemna. The Kidney Stone Cocktail, 3 oz of olive oil & 3 oz of lemone juice worked after taking it twice within six hours, stone moved within two hours of taking the first cocktail but I took the second cocktail just for good measure. I passed three stones a week later. The Kidney Stone Cocktail chased with a large glass of water definitely works. Many thanks!
5632	94	6600	Joe from Pensacola, Florida	2008-03-24 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Thank you so much for this web site. I have had bouts with kidney stones for several years and do not think I ever passed one. Did the 2oz lemon juice and 2oz olive oil twice on day one and once second day. Did not notice any pain reduction but a lot of spasms in affected area. Going to the bathroom this evening and an alien shot out of my penis. My wife who is a health care professional said she had never seen a stone so big.Still having some twinges back there and wondering about multiple stones. Will continue to drink concoction for a couple of days and see what else flushes out.
5633	94	6601	Erin from Harrison, Michigan	2008-03-20 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Well...I started having UTI pain last Tuesday and it continued on and off until Friday. By Friday it was bad, my whole right side hurt and low pain in my groin area, so I went to the ER. I didn't have any infection, but Cat scan results said I did have several kidney stones, so I got pain meds. and followed up with my family doc. on Monday. She referred me to a Urologist, and I got in with him on Tuesday. He discovered then from an X-ray that I had one larger (7mm) stone in my bladder. I had others in my kidneys, but was going to have to have surgery for the large one in the bladder, cuz it wasn't coming out. Yuck!! I didn't want surgery, but he scheduled it anyway, for the following Wednesday. He also gave me Flomax to take once a day to try to help it come out, but he was 50% sure I would be having the surgery. So I came home Tues. evening and took the pill, but I was still searching for a better resolution, and discover this site. So I mixed it up, 2oz fresh squeezed lemon juice and 2oz olive oil, mixed it up and drank it down. I must say, it didn't taste good, but I immediately drank water and ate a snack following the potion. I went to bed, got up on Wed., and nothing, so I did the mix again Wed. afternoon, I only did it once that day, I was going to do it twice, but never did, cuz I really didn't like the taste. Anyway, got up on Thursday (today), did some stuff and went to work out, got home and around 2pm today, went pee, and out it came!!! It really didn't even hurt, just a little twinge and there it was!! So during this whole time, I really never had any pain other than the day I went to ER (that was because it was making it's way to the bladder). I did feel it twinge here and there, but nothing major. I went to the doc this afternoon, got another X-ray, and it's gone!! I still have some in my kidney, but those are smaller and should be able to pass without problems. He also told me to try to drink at least one or two glasses of lemon with water everyday to prevent more from forming, according to him it won't dissolve them, but just help to prevent. So, I don't know, I did take that Flomax on Tues. and Wed., but I didn't today. So, I don't know if that helped too, but I'd say the potion worked for me!!! The surgery is cancelled!! Thanks so much!!!
5634	94	6602	Nick from Tacoma, WA	2008-03-09 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I never post commentaries online, as I believe people's opinions can be biased and prediposed.  However, I needed to post my experience using this kidney stone remedy, as within 9 hours of drinking the 2oz olive oil and 2 oz lemon juice mixture, my kidney stone passed! A brief background on my experience with kidney stones:  I had had one previously in 2005, a 4-5 mm renal stone.  The experience was uncomfortale and, at times, painful.  I initially thought I had appendicitis, as I experienced pain in my side like never before.  I felt like I was going to pass out from the feeling.  An Emergency Room visit confirmed the stone and, after two weeks of an uncomfortable and agonizing feeling of urinating, it spontaneously passed. Fast forward two and a half years later when I had the same feeling two weeks ago.  I wasn't sure it was a kidney stone until the incessant urge to urinate began a day later.  This must be one of the most uncomfortable feelings ever!  Not necessarily painful, however, it is extremely difficult to go to sleep and work, as you constantly find yourself in the bathroom trying to rid yourself of this excruciating sensation. After two weeks, I was ready to try anything.  The vicadin wasn't working as well as it did at the onset and I needed a solution.  I googled kidney stone remedies and this site popped up.  I was, of course, skeptical at first.  However, after reading testimonial upon testimonial of people that the remedy had helped, I figured it couldn't hurt. I simply mixed the 2oz of olive oil with 2oz of lemon juice.  I gulped it down quickly and drank a full 8-12oz of water afterward.  Just an hour or two before the stone passed, I could tell something was going on.  My pain did escalate and I had to take a vicadin, as it was too severe to sit through.  However, the pain mysteriously subsided before the pill could even take effect and a few hours later, the stone passed.  Maybe this was the remedy taking full effect? I'm going to a Urologist in a few weeks in hopes of finding preventative measures to never experience this again.  However, if I am unfortunate enough to have another kidney stone, you will be certain I'll be trying this remedy before anything else! Thanks earthclinic!!!!!
5635	94	6603	Rob from Ft Laud, FL	2008-03-07 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Olive Oil + Lemon Juice = "The" Remedy. So this is my 3rd kidney stone in 5 years. I went through Lithotripsy, Ureteroscopy (which is incredibly painful afterwards because they make you wear a stent for a week and stings everytime you urinate). So along comes child #3 and went online to see about passing the stone with the least pain possible. WARNING!!! DO NOT BUY URIFLOW!!! IT DOESN'T WORK!!! I spent $60 on those pills and all they did to their credit is ease the pain a bit. It was going on 2 1/2 weeks & 2 ER visits later and I was all out of options until I came on this site and found the Olive Oil & Lemon Juice remedy. Let me tell you that this works!!! I felt a little jolt and pop it came out! Didn't hurt at all. Thanks so much for posting this remedy. I finally found the answer!!!
5636	94	6604	Kelly from Orlando, FL	2008-03-07 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Yesterday I woke up with what I thought was a mild stomach ache, but by mid afternoon I realized that it was a kidney stone.  I recognized this because almost 4 years ago I had to go to the emergency room for my first kidney stone.  I wasn't crazy about going to the hospital again so with a lot of scepticism I decided to try the 2oz of lemon juice, 2oz of olive oil remedy.  I drank the first mixture in the late afternoon and then another before going to bed, this time 3oz of lemon juice and 3 oz of olive oil.  I finally fell asleep around 3am.  I woke up 7 hours later, very surprised that I didn't seem to have anymore pain.  A few hours later I passed a 2-3 mm stone with absolutely no pain.  What amazed me even more was that my first stone 4 years ago took 4 days to pass while under a doctor's treatment.  I'm a believer.  Thanks!
6004	97	6966	Monique from Miami, Florida	2007-12-03 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I tried the apple cider vinegar remedy because for the past year I have been on several antibiotics for sinus infections. The first dose cleared me completely. I now use it twice a day and I have begun adding cayenne and honey to my oatmeal in the morning which tastes like a gourmet thai dish and has reduced the inflammation that I was having in my face due to the sinus issues. Thank you!
5637	94	6605	Lewis from Leland, No Car	2008-03-04 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I read all the postings about the kidney stone problem. I figured I had nothing to lose since lemon juice and olive oil sound like nothing more dangerous than salad dressing. Bought house brand Virgin Olive oil and house brand bottle of lemon juice (reconstituted from concentrate - whatever that means!) Total cash outlay $4.45. A reasonable amount - considering any alternative treatment. After two days of two swallows per day (2 oz of each, followed by glass of water) pain seemed to subside. After 4 days, ALL GONE! I don't know if the little pebble disolved and passed or if it just reduced in size to where it no longer bothers me. All I know is that if the pain should again be felt, I will start the routine again. It's been a week now - and so far I'm still AOK. Thank you website creators and contributors!

5639	94	6607	Mike from St. Louis, U.S.	2008-02-26 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I had my kidney stone for 6 days until i finally found this remedy.  I had a 4 mm stone and i wasnt having any pain.  I drank tons and tons of water for a week and nothing came out.  So i tried the 3oz lemon juice and 3oz olive oil combination.  i did this 3 times the first day and 2 times the next two days.  by the weekend, i gave up and thought it wouldn't do anything for me. then on monday, i went for a checkup at the urologist. he took an x-ray of my bladder and we couldn't find any stone! His conclusion was that i passed it and didnt even realize it.  I was so happy because i didnt have to go through the pain of passing the stone.  It probably dissolved into teeny tiny fragments from the lemon juice and olive oil.  As far as i know, this remedy worked for me.  Chances were that i had a calcium oxalate stone.  So for any of your that are skeptical about dissolving kidney stones (and i know everyone is different) give this remedy a try.  if this makes you sick, just add lemon juice to your water.  Ive read that calcium stones cant survive in acidic conditions. So if you drink a lot of water, stay active, and drink some acidic drinks, you'll have a good chance of breaking up a stone.  If i could do it with a 4mm stone, a lot is possible.

5641	94	6609	B from slc, ut	2008-02-19 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I never post much online, but something like this, I felt better weigh in. With my stone, I was willing to try just about anything other than go back through the lithotripsy. I read this a few months ago, and gave the remedy a whirl, didn't do much right away, but after about 4 days of doing the recomended doses, I had virtually no pain or burn while urinating. :-) A few months later, after suffering a couple aftershocks of pain, including one on the golf course, and I could do nothing about it, I started back on the sauce regularly. One evening last week, I was whizzing away, when my whole body jumped and jolted, I was startled as to what had happened. Then I looked at the bottom of the toilet and saw a rock-looking thing.Still have not had it anylized, but I feel better, no pain, no irritation. I dunno, but I think the concoction works, it sure helps if nothing else! Thanks for the help! You can post this if you want.
5642	94	6610	Jeanie from Portland, OR	2008-02-18 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I wanted to thank you for your recipe of Lemon Juice and Olive Oil. My husband had this terrible pain in his right flank. He knew it was a stone because he had one 10 years ago.
5643	94	6611	Jordan from Providence, RI	2008-02-17 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I recently struggled with the pain associated with the movement of a kidney stone for 4 days before coming across the Lemon Juice and Olive Oil remedy. At first I was a bit skeptical, but this was my second time having a stone. The remedy was said to work favorably for calcium oxalate stones, so I decided to give it a try. Day 5 I drank my first dose just before going to bed (followed by 12oz water). Day 6 I experienced the first full day without any pain or medication. I was unsure of whether or not I could drink the mixture two days in a row so I only drank water and juice. Day 7 I drank my second mix some time in the late afternoon (followed by 8oz water). Again, I had no pain or need for medication all day. Day 8 I passed the stone while using the restroom after waking up. There was no pain involved in urinating to pass the stone.
5644	94	6612	Lindsey from Portsmouth, NH	2008-02-16 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Last Saturday morning I felt like I had a UTI, went to the ER because I was very uncomfortable and there was blood in my urine. Initial culture indicated no infection, but I was prescribed the antibiotic Bactrim. The Bactrim provided no relief from my symptoms (constant feeling of needing to urinate, very uncomfortable pressure in what felt like my urethra). Quickly developed mild allergic reaction to the sulfur in the Bactrim (canker sores in my mouth),' and asked for another antibiotic at the Dr. s office. They took a second urine culture, which was also negative for signs of infection, but had trace amounts of blood. I was prescribed Cipro and asked to to to the hospital for an ultrasound. The ultrasound revealed a 1cm kidney stone at the very end of my ureter, just at the junction of the ureter and the bladder. The Dr. called quickly thereafter saying I would likely need to undergo some type of procedeure to have the stone removed. I then found this site, spent a long time reading the posts and decided to try the lemon and olive oil. At 10:00pm on Thursday evening I drank 2 oz of lemon juice and sopped up about 1.5 oz of olive oil with some bread. At 6:30am the following morning I noticed the pain was gone in what felt before like my urethra, but now that I have a better understanding of where the ureter meets with the bladder, I knew it had been coming from the spot where the stone was seen. They are extremely close together! Ten minutes later I had, with some serious trepidation, peed out a stone that was 5mm in width. I was thrilled, felt significantly better, and continued taking a few oz. of straight lemon juice and some olive oil (always with bread) throughout the day. Nothing else visible has come out, but I feel 100% better and can't wait to get the reaction from the Urologist I'm scheduled to see Monday morning! Thanks for this site- I feel as if it saved me from enduring more pain, and a medical procedure to eliminate the stone (not to mention the money it would have cost). Three month ago I began taking supplemental calcium at the suggestion of my Doctor. I have since read in a number of studies that supplemental calcium (opposed to dietary calcium) is correlated with a higher incidence of kidney stones. If the results from the lab indicated that the stone I passed is the Calcium Oxylate variety, the mystery will be solved!

I haven't got rid of my stone tho. I want to say that some people that are prone to getting kidney stones really need to watch out for sodas and foods that contain phosphoric acid for some people it makes them form stones faster. I have to stay away from it, I forgot once and had a couple rum and cokes and not even a week later I was in a lot pain and trying to pass a stone. I believe that my dr told me I form oxalate stones.Not sure where I am gonna go from here.
5646	94	6614	Brian from Palmerton, PA	2008-02-06 00:00:00	NAY	1	0	I tried 3oz of Lemon Juice and 3oz Virgin Olive Oil to help pass my 5mm kidney stone. It stayed in me for 2 hours until I threw it all up. Not trying that again!
5647	94	6615	Athena from Chicago, IL	2008-02-02 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	WOW! I used 3 oz of fresh lemon and 3 oz of EVOO and followed it with a quick 12 oz of water every hour.  In 20 minutes the pain subsided.  In 2 hours I could feel the stone moving down through my side without pain.  Very strange feeling but not at all painful.   Then in a total of 3 and a half hours total, I felt a strong urge to go and two huge stones came out one after the other.   Also, I must have had a lot of fluid because I really kept going.  Then I puked a couple of times from all that stuff but it was well worth it.  I lost 4.5  pounds of fluid in those few hours.  It is not the best thing to drink but when you guzzle it down it goes much better.  I will never try anything else ever again and I tried everything.  The doctor told me my stones were too big to pass, but either mine broke in two (there were lots of small particles as well) or I passed two or more.  My stones were calcium.

Unfortunately, this didn't work at all on my kidney (ureteral) stone, which was first discovered after an agonizing ER visit 3 months ago Stone 8mm was stuck just before the bladder which required Lithotripsy. I was very anxious about the procedure, but it was actually a walk in the park. They put me to sleep for 45 minutes, pulverized the stone and woke me up. No pain or awareness that I even had a procedure. First urine after procedure was very bloody which is mentally difficult. I was in and out of the outpatient in just' a few hours and am glad to be home.

This  is the first time I have had them and let me tell you...I am so happy that I found this lemon juice - extra virgin olive oil remedy.  I am not sure if I have passed the big stone, but I have passed a lot of small crystal like stuff and the pain is gone completely at this point.  I will update as the this evening and the next day goes by.  Thank God for the person that figured this out.

I saw 5 different doctors and had to make 3 visits to the ER.  I was put on so many different medications....... it was a nightmare.  I read the post on this site and I immediatly tried it.......  OMG, 12 hours later a passed a huge (3mm) jaged stone.... it hurt but at the same time felt like heaven, becuase I knew that the remedy worked..... thank you... pure lemon juice and olive oil.
5652	94	6620	Debbie from Las Vegas, Nevada	2008-01-08 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I had kidney stones in 2002, the surgery was terrible and painful and I almost died from backup when the docotrs removed the stents too soon. The stones returned in June of 2007. The doctors give the run around while trying to get them removed, all the HMO crap with referrals and required tests. Anyway, last night at 9:15pm I drank the 2oz olive oil and 2 oz fresh squeezed lemon juice mixture followed by 12 ounces of water. At 7:15am I passed 4 stones. Meanwhile I felt a lot of pain and movement so I think there is more in there. As the day went on the pain subsided and the bleeding came to a stop. I think they are finally all gone. I am sore but probably in a few days I should be fine. I will now drink the mixture once a month since I am now a believer. It is easy to drink and it reminded me of something you would put on a salad. All in all, it sure beats the pain of the stones and the surgery that doctors perform. Pass the remedy to all and keep people from having surgery.

The mix used was 3oz concentrated lemon juice and 3oz extra virgin olive oil. The bleeding stopped within 2 hours. The stone passed within 12 hours. The pain meds did cause constipation
5654	94	6622	Tress from puy, wa	2008-01-06 00:00:00	NAY	1	0	I have a 2-3 mm stone that I have had for 5 weeks now.  Popped it out of my left kidney in the ER on Dec 1st.  I finally saw a urologist last week who wants to do surgery on Tuesday - Jan 8th.  I have a CT Scan at the ER which showed a 3mm stone in my left ureter.  I had a CT Scan - IVP on Dec 19th which showed the 2-3mm stone was now at the opening of my bladder but I just can't rid myself of this darn thing!  I tried the lemon juice, oil mixture Friday night and all day Saturday.  Today is Sunday 10am and NOTHING!  NADA, still have this darn stone.  I guess I will move on to try the coke/asparagus thing and then maybe celery seed tea...pray for me, wish me luck, I do not want surgery
5655	94	6623	James from Ephrata, Washington	2008-01-04 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	While I use other remedies from this website with great success, I was very skeptical about the "lemon juice-olive oil" remedy for kidney stones. I'm no longer skeptical and here's why. After reading the "yeas and nays", I decieded to give the concoction a try even though at the time, I was not experiencing any pain whatsoever from the four stones inhabiting my kidneys. I drank the 2oz lemon juice + 2oz extra virgin olive oil on an empty stomach, the morning of December 30th. That evening after coming home from work and while sitting and relaxing, I felt a kidney stone pass into my bladder. No pain whatsoever. I went to the bathroom and passed the stone. Again, no pain or discomfort. I've since passed two more after using the "recipe". It worked for me. The recipe ingredients can do you no harm. There's nothing to lose by trying this, except the pain and the stones.
5656	94	6624	Rafael Rodriguez from Charlotte, NC	2008-01-04 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	The mix of lemons and olive oil is definitely is an excellent way to dissolve the kidney stones, it works for me, after a week of intense pain, I when to 2 different hospitals ER and both told me that a had a 6mm kidney stone, they both did the same, they' did CT scans on me and after that they gave me a bunch of drugs to deal with my pain, that was all, after charging  me with X amount of dollars they send me home with the same unbearable pain,  they also told me to contact a urologist and I did , only to find out that in order for them to begin the treatment to dissolve the kidney stone they need it $100.00 just for the appointment and them approximately between $7.000 and $9.000 dollars to try to dissolve the stone, since I did not have insurance I started to look for answers on the internet and that was how I find out about this website. I tried the mix of lemons and olive oil in the morning, I drank 2 oz of lemons juice mixed with 2oz of Olive Oil at 10:30am, I waited and try again at 4:30pm the same day, the next day at 8:30am the stone was out of my body. I think you guys are doing an excellent public service providing this kind of information. Thanks so much ...
5657	94	6625	Patrick from Swindon, England	2007-12-30 00:00:00	NAY	1	0	[QUESTION] re: LEMON JUICE AND OLIVE OIL VITAMIN C -- The RDA for vitamin C in adults is 60 mg per day. Large doses of vitamin C are considered to be toxic in persons with a family history of or tendency to form kidney stones or gallbladder stones. Kidney and gallbladder stones usually consist of calcium oxalate. Oxalate occurs in high concentrations in foods such as cocoa, chocolate, rhubarb, and spinach. A fraction of the vitamin C in the body is normally broken down in the body to produce oxalate. A daily supplement of 3.0 grams of vitamin C has been found to double the level of oxalate that passes through the kidneys and is excreted into the urine. with this above, would it not add to your problems by drinking high vit c lime or lemon?
5658	94	6626	Malhar from Auckland, NZ	2007-12-28 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Hi all, The Olive Oil and Lemon Juice remedy is magic for kidney stones. After rolling on the floor in pain, and a few pain killer injections and pills later, this was a life saver. Having gone through lithotripsy last year, I did not really want to go through that again. Fortunately, the specialist was away during the holidays, so did not get an appointment. I decided to give this a shot since I had nothing to lose. 3 table spoons of extra virgin olive oil and fresh lemon juice thrice in 24 hours did the trick for me. The' stone passed with my urine 24 within hours of the last dose. I have to admit that it is not the best taste, but heaps better than the pain. Perhaps the other thing that must have helped is the half litre water I was drinking every one hour and passing urine regularly. There was a time when there was a bit of blood in the urine, but i suppose that's when the stone was making its way down. "Clink" against the porcelin sounded musinc to the ears. I don't know how to thank the creators of this web site and the remedy.
5659	94	6627	Susan from Dallas, USA	2007-12-15 00:00:00	NAY	1	0	I've had a kidney stone for over two weeks now.  I read this information on-line and decided to try it since drinking large amounts of water has not helped it to pass.  The pain has been absolutely unbearable and I have been taking upwards of 80 mg of codeine a day. I tried this remedy for two days and as I am used to the taste of Olive Oil, it did not taste bad for me but I was only able to keep it on my stomach for about 3 hours - (tried 4 times) before throwing it up.  I don't know if that's the pain, the codeine or what, but the pain was never releived and the kidney stone is still there a week after trying this.  I've tried the Apple Cider and drinking Lemon Juice with Hot Water also and no relief.  This rememdy must be for small kidney stones and as I have a tendency to have large ones, this is not going to help it "slide out". I have calcium oxalyte stones and anything acidic will not help them to dissolve - mine is the most common type but this rememdy is for those that have the other three types of stones so for those of you with oxalyte stones - I'd say, don't waste your time. If anyone knows of anything for oxalyte stones, please let me know.  I am currently trying (started yesterday) on Uriflow - we'll see how that works since I have no insurance.

I had been dealing with a kidney stone for about a week and was getting impatient waiting for it to pass (I know some of you have been dealing with kidney stones alot longer!) I have to admit I was quite skeptical of the remedy, but certainly willing to try anything that might help. I drank the mixture at 10:00 in the evening, and drank lots of water before bed. At noon the next day I passed the stone without pain.  I was so excited it basically brought me to tears.  If I ever have to deal with another kidney stone, this remedy will definitely be the first one tried.
5661	94	6629	Sadik Khan from Porbandar, India	2007-12-13 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	First of all, I am sorry for being a little late to update you guys. So, I had the kidney stone problem and the doctor advised me for immediate operation. The stone was 7.2mm and got stuck in the uterus (I hope this is what it was, I just forgot by now, thanks to Earth Clinic Community). This was in march 2007. I had undergone the operation and the problem got sorted out, for a while. All of sudden the stone re-emerged (may be reformed) within one month. I was so disappointed and had no liking going for another round at the doctors operation table. And then I found yoursite, earth clinic. I tried the above mentioned remedy. I was quite hopefull that it will dissolve the stone. But nothing noticiable happened during the first time. So I thought of trying it again on weekend. This time, I could feel the difference. The stone started to move. I went to office and had to come home in the middle of severe pain. I took the pain killer for the day and went to sleep. The next morning, to my surprise, I had passed the stone. I am so glad, thanks to everybody. Though I am a software enginee, I had never believed internet so much before, but I can assure you now, I am a real person who had gone through the pain all the time and I am very happy now.

5663	94	6631	James from London, UK	2007-12-11 00:00:00	NAY	1	0	I note that most of the naysayers gave up after trying the remedy just once or twice or only once a day or every other day, whereas most of those who were successful tried it several times a day initially. I also note that the naysayers mostly tried the smaller 2 ounce dosage and a good few complained about the taste, whereas the yeasayers were less put off by the taste and many who tried the 2 ounce dosage went on to try the 3 ounce one (something most of the naysayers apparently failed to do).
5664	94	6632	Kelly from Toronto, Canada	2007-12-10 00:00:00	NAY	1	0	re Kidney Stones (Olive Oil & Lemon) -- So far, this is a "Nay" for me. I tried it for 2 days then went to just squeezing lemons into a large glass of water every couple of hours. The 3rd day spent drinking hot water with apple cider vinegar, to no avail. My stomach got so acidic I had to stop. I even drank a whole beer. And I HATE beer! ' I tend to have kidney pain for a couple of months before they try to pass so I'm due for an ER visit within the next week or so. Exact same thing happened last year - spent Xmas and NY in the hospital, finally having 2 surgically removed (1 in Jan and 1 in Feb, missing a couple of months of work). The problem is that I am going to Mexico in a week and am terrified to spend the trip in the hospital (or worse, have an attack on the plane!). Don't even know if there is a hospital near the resort.    Maybe I did something wrong when I tried the remedy or my type of stone is different than the success stories? My questions are: Should the remedy be done on an empty stomach? Should you rest or exercise? Is it just for stones already travelling? Mine are just sitting in my kidney with gradually increasing discomfort for over 3 mos and haven't yet attempted to leave.  That's when the real fun begins! For the last week I can't sleep at night because the pain is getting worse. That's how I know it will be soon.    I will try anything not to have to go through that agony EVER again! I was in ER so many times last year all the staff knew me by name and the only relief was morphine. Thank you for your time.
5665	94	6633	Jason from Geneva, Switzerland	2007-12-07 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	The olive oil and lemon juice remedy works. I had a kidney stone that would not pass for three+ months. Out of desperation I found the olive oil and lemon juice suggestion. I mixed 2 oz of both EVOO and Lemon Juice. I won't lie, it's gross to drink. I felt some movement, but nothing passed. The next morning I tried 3 oz of both the olive oil and lemon juice and after about three hours it passed. It really was unimaginable that this actually would work. No doubt that this will be my first option next time.
5666	94	6634	Mont from Stockton, CA	2007-12-06 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	12/5/07 I went in for a third procedure in 20 years yesterday and was shocked to hear the urologist say there were no stones in my left ureter after I woke from the procedure. Three weeks ago we had looked at the CT scan and the four stones I had. Two in the right kidney and on the left side were two big stones stacked on each other above the bladder and the doctor said they would not pass, too big, must take them out. I have passed six stones without surgery before, so I remained hopeful waiting for surgery. But even after getting some relief from' herbal pills  I had more pain than I could take, begging the E.R. to take me right then three different days. during the first consultation after the scan the urologist told me of a study at SF with lemon juice to acidify the urine and was having good results. I searched this site and made lemonade with a small amount of sugar and 6 lemons, then ate French bread soaked in olive oil. That night I must have dissolved the stones because my urine flow was back the next morning and I thought maybe the sharp edges have been smoothed but still had the stones. Little did I know that the stones would be gone when the doctor was to blast them with the laser yesterday. Kidney stones are the worst pain ever and with my family history, I was getting discouraged. Being in such agony I was sure I would suffer a heart attack one day. Now I have hopes for lemon juice. I drink juice from half a lemon and boiling water each morning, afternoon and night. It does not bother my stomach and even smoothed out my appetite. I have lost 60 lbs. this last year and now will try to cut out the peanut butter, cola, chocolate and other foods that on the list of things that produce my type of stones. I have a follow up appointment next week and will keep posting the progress on my other two small stones on the right side. With any luck they have exited my body also. I will have a urinalysis  and hope that this natural remedy will be the answer to my prayers. Thank you Earth Clinic for providing information that inspired me to follow up on the doctors recommendation to drink the lemon juice three times a day.

I was slightly skeptical but had nothing to lose. So I tried it following an ultrasound which determined the kidney stone was stuck at the bottom of my ureter. I squeezed 5 lemons mixed with 3 tbsps. of olive in around a quart of water. I drank half that evening and the other half the next day. The stone flushed out the second day-I was stunned at how quickly the remedy worked. All the pain is gone and I won't be needing surgery.

5670	94	6638	Celia from Chicago, IL	2007-11-21 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I've gone through the pain of kidney stones three times, twice followed by lithotrypsy.  I promised myself that if it happened again I would do my best to stay away from the hospital.  Not having health insurance this time sealed the deal.  I felt symptoms at about 4pm.  Drank water and fullness intensified.  I added lemon.  Then I read this site and used 2oz each of organic lemon juices (from a lemon) and olive oil.  I walked around my apartment and jogged in place.   Pain intensified and I felt a little nausea.  Took Ibuprofen and almost immediately vomited.  I felt better after that, continued sipping water and water with lemon.  The stone passed at 9:30pm - a few minutes ago.  It was about 7x2mm with lots of sandy bits.  I don't know if there is anything behind it, but my urine is flowing normally, no blood, and no pain.  On this Thanksgiving eve, I thank you all so much!
5671	94	6639	Grace from Plantersville, TeXas	2007-11-21 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Okay 2 weeks ago tomorrow I woke up in the middle of the night to horrible pain in my left side, under my rib cage.  I thought I was dying, only to be rushed by an ambulance to the ER.  4 hours and 8 thousand dollars later they determined I had a 5.7 MM Kidney stone that had left the kidney and was heading to the bladder.  The pain for the next 3-4 days was horrible.  But I got on this site and read about the Olive Oil/Lemmon Juice thing... So here is my story. For the past 3 years I have drank about a gallon of water per day.  I don't drink carbonated drinks, but about 2 months ago I was hooked on RedBull.  So I am not sure what caused it.  To ease the initial pain I took lots of pain pills and motrin.  At first there was lots of nausea and vomiting from the stone.  After I got on this site and read I tried the olive oil and lemon juice. 2.oz of each... NOTHING... 24 hour later I did it again. ... then again and again.  4 times.  Then I was advised to get in the bathtub and drink beer.  So I tried that.  NOTHING...So I started thinking about the lemmon juice and olive oil.  I think that the cure only works after the stone has made it to the bladder. Because Last NIGHT in my final desparation I drank 4 oz of Virgin Olive Oil and 4 oz of Ice cold Lemon mixed and this morning at 5:00 am it passed. I honestly feel like a new person.  The 4 prior olive oil and lemon juices did ease the pain, a bit, but I was drinking a gallon of water a day, a 1/2 gallon of Cranberry Juice and taking cranberry pills and AZO...the motrin and the pain pills~ but I think that the larger concaution of lemon juice and olive oil last night (followed by 2 bottles of water)pushed it from the Bladder out. Once it was in the Bladder... like 4 days ago... I only felt like I had to pee all the time... there was no deadly pain like it was when it left the kidney initially. Good LUCK!
5672	94	6640	Tony from San diego, California	2007-11-17 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Out of desperation I looked on the internet today to seek home remedies. I'm not a huge believer of these things but kidney stones make you try anything to get rid of them. I found this page at 9 am and tried the lemon and olive oil recipe. Then at 5pm I took another doze. I did feel the stone move down in my bladder as the pain gotten sharper. Arpund 10 pm the same day the stone came out. About 6 mm wide. Pretty big. This is only my experience and I wanted to share with others. I have been drinking cranberry juice the last 2 days and also taking flomax.Thanks to everyone who took their time to post on this page.
5673	94	6641	Terry from Sevierville, Tennessee	2007-11-08 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have been pagued with kidney stones since the age of 17.  I am now 43 and had to have a stone removed last week using a cystoscope.  The stone was lodged about an inch from my bladder and would not pass.  I went to my doctor and told him I was also having pain in the opposite kidney, but he said the CT was clear on the other side and that it could be "referred" pain.  By the way, I have a great doctor and trust him completely. Yesterday I found this website and thought what the heck...it's all natural and can't hurt.  Since I have not had any pain in the last couple of days and had one removed last week I thought I would try it and see how it tasted. The taste was horrible, but quickly went away and I thought if it worked it would be well worth it. This morning I went to the bathroom (no pain) and heard the familiar "clink" of a stone hitting the porcelian.  I was amazed!  I really didn't think I had another stone since the doctor said the left side was clear.  This was a relatively small stone ( 1mm wide by 3 mm long....looked like a comet).  Nevertheless, I am sold on the olive oil and lemon juice. Additionally, I did not follow the remedy with a lot of water, but rather some green tea...I've tried everything). I'm sold!  I will drink it once a month or so from now on!
5674	94	6642	David from Kumamoto, Japan	2007-11-01 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I am living in Japan and my company required me to get a physical. I arrived on Friday for the physical and part of it involved a kidney scan using ultrasonics. They told me they could see a 10mm kidney stone and said I should return Monday so a specialist could see it and (probably) schedule surgery! However, this proceedure, apparently, got the' stone moving because shortly after that I began to feel pain in my lower left back. The pain was pretty intense and many people were commenting how bad I looked. I found this website and treatment and was willing to try anything to stop the pain and prevent surgery. I tried the remedy at about 6:30 pm and layed down. At 7pm I called my friend and said if the pain didn't get better soon, I wanted to go to the hospital. I tried the remedy again after that and at about 9pm I rolled over to turn on a light...and had very reduced pain! I did the drink again and went to sleep at about 10:30. Saturday, the pain was very slight and I went about my daily tasks. I took the remedy three more times that day and twice on Sunday. When Monday rolled around and I went back to the hospital, I was whistling and snapping my fingers..the doctor said she had never seen a kidney stone patient do THAT before! I challenged her to find the stone, she couldn't. She said she KNEW I didn't pass it...so what happened? I told her of the remedy and asked her to try it on future patients. She said there were 3 others right outside and she would try it immediately! So this 'cure' is international now!!! Thank you!!!

After 3 days suffering for it to come out,I can see that the stone was making a very slow progress. Luckily I found your website and decided to try your oil and lemon formula. I took the first one at 8:00PM ,another one at 8:00AM next day and the third one at 1:00PM' .In between I took as much water as I can. The stone came out at 6:00PM. Thank you very much for sharing this live saving remedy.
5676	94	6644	Louis from Davao, Philippines	2007-10-18 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I tried the Olive Oil + Lemon Juice treatment( well it was Calamansi juice as lemons are hard to find here).  I had been suffering from a kidney stone for 3 days and found this treatment on the web.  Took 2oz each at 7am and drank lots of water.  Felt better but still didn't pass the stone.  Later at 5pm took another dose with 3oz each this time.  Within 15 mins I felt a prickle at the base of my penis and went to urinate.  Bang! out shot both stones the longer was 1/2" long and the shorter one maybe 1/8" long.  Boy do I feel better now and I didn't have to have ivasive surgery to get cured.
5677	94	6645	Frank from Johnstown, New York	2007-09-24 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I took the "juice" today around 11am and again around 4pm.  I could feel something moving all day in my kidney.  Around 11pm tonight my pain was almost completly gone and I no longer had pain when i was urinating.  My urine stream also seemed to be stronger.  I've tried to strain my urine but I could not do this everytime i went to the bathroom, which is quite often.  I think it may be gone.  I'll let you know more.

I am in hopes the lemon juice and olive oil works for me. One thing that may' be a problem with the nays is, their stone is too large to pass. Crossing my fingers on this one. Just mix.
5679	94	6647	Darren from Houston, Texas	2007-09-22 00:00:00	BETTER BUT NOT CURED	2	0	My attack started about 5:30 am yesterday morning, I know this sounds crazy but I went for a jog hoping to help the stone pass.  I have read somewhere that jump up and down and jogging will help the stone move through the Ureter and not only that the pain stops as well.  Which it did for me, I don't know if that is true or not, but us "kidney stoners" will try anything to make the pain stop!  However, once I got back from my jog and jumping up and down I was beat and I wanted to do nothing more than to lie down and go back to sleep.  About 10 minutes later the pain came back sharp.  After 8:30 am hit I was still in steady pain, I decided to go to the Emergency Room.  The ER nurse gave me Demerol and something for my nausea stomach.  That seemed to do the trick.  After about 30 minutes I could feel the stone moving.  The doctor came back about 12:30 pm and said that I had 3mm stone lodged my Ureter.  So he gave me some medicine and sent me home.  I could still feel the stone nagging a bit, but nothing like the pain I experienced earlier in that morning.  Later in the afternoon I could still fill that stubborn stone in my right side.  That's when I started doing some research on the web about kidney stones and came across this website.  I started reading all the comments posted by others yeahs and the nays. My conclusion was (1) my stones are not as near bad as others on this site, I can't even imagine what they are going through and my sympathy goes out to them and (2) this would not work for everyone since there are different stones, sizes and body chemistry.  However, since my pain was still nagging at my Ureter since I've been back from the ER, I thought I'd give the Olive Oil and Lemon Juice drink a shot.  I would have to say that it's not all that bad of a drink; it's almost like a lemon zest salad dressing, which by the way might not be a bad dressing the salads.  You could kill 2 birds with one stone, have it as a dressing and get rid of your kidney stones.  It was around 8:00 pm when I guzzled it down.  About 30 minutes later I had a tuna fish sandwich with some iced tea and gram crackers. By 8:45 pm my pain had completely stopped!  As some have reported about being nausea after drinking it, I didn't experience that.   As I'm writing this its 9:08 am the next morning and I have urinated 3 times since and no stone.  Also I have experienced ZERO pain, no nagging on the right side at all.  So I am going to keep everyone updated with my progress over the next few days and weeks until the stone passes.  I am not going to drink the salad dressing drink until I start to feel the pain coming back.  I will though drink plenty of fluids until the stone passes. My other task is to try and get the remaining stones in my kidneys resolved by following what "4/23/2006: Bertha from Phoenix " wrote about  in her post However, I am going to take on a daily basis 400 mg of Magnesium,  1 gm Calcium and (B-Complex 2 times daily).  I believe this only works if you have calcium oxalate stones.  I don't know if this would work on the other types of stones. My History of Kidney Stones: I had my first attack 1994 about 3:30 in the morning.  Since I didn't know what it was I decided to go to the ER after 30 minutes of pain.  Once I got the ER the pain had stopped.  They kept me there and did CT scan and X-rays.  That's when they discovered that I have kidney stones.  After that I never had another attack until 2004, ten years later.  I think I had about 3 attacks in 2004, went to the ER once again.  Then another CT scan and x-rays, that's when they discovered both of my kidneys are filled will small stones, they were anywhere between 2mm  4mm.  I am still trying to get an estimate on exactly how many stones are actually in there.  The stones that I have are calcium oxalate.  They sent me to a nutritionist to explain about the foods to avoid.  Which were nuts, berries, chocolate and etc...They also did every single test that you could imagine to see if my body was producing high levels of calcium oxalate.   Which it wasn't, they had no idea of how I got them and told me that my body is not producing the levels of calcium oxalate that could form the stones.  The only thing I can figure out was that it must have been something that I ate or drank a lot of or(lack of) in the past, maybe about 10 years ago or so.  When I lived in Arizona back in 1994 for 6 years (now looking back at it) I can remember when I didn't drink that much water and I would take in high levels of workout supplements such as weight gainer and creatine for about 1 year.  I am not sure if that had anything to do with it or not but I think something that I did in my past must have contributed to me forming the stones.  I am 36 years old health male and eat fairly health foods (no junk foods).  I don't over eat too much of one thing.  Since 2nd episode in 2004 I started making sure I drink plenty of water.  I have water at every meal and throughout the day.  I would say I have about (4 -6) glasses of 8 oz of water a day.  I know that isn't enough but I bump up my water intake when I start passing stones to 10 -12 glasses of 8oz water a day.  Since 2004 drinking more water especially over the last 2 years my attacks are happening more frequent, so I am guessing the water is flushing out my stones.  In 2006 I had 3 attacks as well and went back to the doctor again and they said that the stones were still there in both kidneys but had not grown at all in size at all.  One thing that is really strange is that ALL of my attacks have been on the right side; I have never had an attack on the left side.  I know the left side is due so I am hoping to find some good remedies.  Thank God I have free medical benefits from the military or this would have cost me a fortune every time I went to the ER and doctor.  The only way I could cope with the pain was to go the ER and have them give me Demerol.  The doctors tell me that my stones are too small for surgery and that I will have to pass them. The last CT scan as of September 21, 2007, found small stones still in both kidneys, 2mm-3mm.  My task is to try and get the remaining stones in my kidneys resolved by following what "4/23/2006: Bertha from Phoenix " wrote about in her post However, I am going to take on a daily basis 400 mg of Magnesium,  1 gm Calcium and (B-Complex 2 times daily).  I believe this only works if you have calcium oxalate stones.  I don't know if this would work on the other types of stones.  I am hoping this well dissolve the stones since my kidneys are not forming them anymore. Wish us all the best with our stones and remember "Try to Jump up and Down or may go for a jog the next time your passing a stone".  Just make sure you do it in room where your neighbors don't see you.
5680	94	6648	Rose from Cheyenne, Wyoming	2007-09-14 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Found recipe of 3 oz Extra virgin Olive Oil and 3 oz of lemon juice. My adult son started feeling the pain of his first kidney stone at 6AM and he got into doctor at 10:30, in extreme pain, got a shot in office, then a CT scan to confirm that is what is was. At home at 1PM he started the lemon juice and olive oil and in 24 hours it passed and he said it didn't hurt when it passed. I am guessing the lemon juice must have helped dissolve the edges perhaps. Directions we got was 3 X a day with the oil and lemon.

X-RAY REVEALED 4-5 STONES IN MY RIGHT URETER. A "STEINSTRASSE" AS MY UROLOGIST CALLED IT. THIS WAS THE RESULT OF LITHOTRIPSY TO BREAK UP A 12MM STONE. DOC CAN'T BELIEVE THEY ARE GONE. WANTS EVEN MORE X-RAYS AFTER HE AND RADIOLOGY DOCTORS COULDN'T FIND ANY STONES ON 10 X-RAY SHOTS WITH DYE. I'M NOT GONNA TELL HIM A DAMN THING ABOUT HOW I GOT RID OF 'EM. HEH HEH HEH.

5683	94	6651	Deborah from Berlin, New Jersey	2007-08-19 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	My dear boyfiend Bob was suffering with a kidney stone. His urologist did a treatment where he pushed a strawlike tube(under local anesthesia) up Bob's private part and into his urinary tract in the hopes of dislodging/removing his kidney stone. The doctor only pushed the stone back up into his bladder. Doctor Wonderful then advised Bob to set up an appointment to get put to sleep and the doc would use a large instrument to grasp the stone. Bob wasn't thrilled with this idea because after the first session he had some bleeding and burning upon urination which was very uncomfortable. Anyway...as a loving friend that I am, I went online and saw the remedy of olive oil and lemon juice. Bob followed the instructions. 2 ounces of EVO (as Rachel Ray would say) extra virgin oil and l squeezed lemon. He drank it down like 2 shots of liquor. After 24 hours when he went tinkle, he felt a stinging pain in his lower groin, and a couple of hours later while urinating he passed a brownish rough edged stone the size of a green pea. I was stunned by the size of it, (I'm sure they can be larger), but the fact that such a hard stone of that size can pass through a male's penis. So...it can be done and this is my testimony. Try it before or while you see these medical guys to shove stuff up your privates, and possibly do more damage. What can it hurt. Oh...Bob did say he was burping up the taste of olive oil and felt a little nauseaus, but nothing unbearable. He is so relieved...me too and I don't want to see my loved ones suffer!!! Thank you.

5685	94	6653	Stacy from Gloucester, Virginia	2007-08-07 00:00:00	NAY	1	0	I am a Nay....I mixed up the juice and oil and it didn't taste bad. The only problem is I can't keep it down. I am not sure if it is the mixture or just the pain but I vomitted so much that I couldn't stand up, got the shakes, and cold sweats. A very unpleasant experience. I wound up in the emergency room getting an IV full of antibiotics, anti nausea, and pain killers. I will say though that after this attack I am going to try the concotion again to see if it will help clean out my kidney without the massive pain.

5690	94	6658	Jim from Providence, RI	2007-07-13 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I was browsing and found this article. I had just passed a kidney stone BEFORE reading the olive oil and lemon juice suggestion. I tried it anyways to see whether it would bring up any additional stones. Guess what? IT DID!! The stone it brought up about 12 hours later was DOUBLE the size of the first stone. I have had no problems since and feel great. This was an amazing discovery. I highly recommend it to everyone.
5691	94	6659	Jim from las vagas, nevada	2007-07-12 00:00:00	NAY	1	0	I came across this remedy and thought what the heck I have a 4mm stuck kidney stone on my right side. I had already passed on that was there, but found this one is stuck. I tried the remedy, did not work the fist night,tried it again for two weeks twice a day, still no luck. now here is is two months after they were discovered, had a ct and found now insted of a 4mm stone it has growen to a 7mm I have to have it removed.This remedy might work on stones already moveing to help them move faster, but it did not shrink,disolve, or move my stuck stone just left me to hold onto it longer so it got bigger. Don't belive everything you read. The remedy was not that bad a taste, and it wont hurt you......

5693	94	6661	Brian from Miami, Florida	2007-07-03 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I tried the Kidney Stone remedy with the olive oil and the lemons. Used two ounces of fresh squeezed lemon juice and 2 ounces of extra virgin olive oil. It was the nastiest thing I ever had to drink before. But since I have had surgery on kidney stones before I thought what the heck...well it works, that simple. Pain went away and for the next 24 hours saw pieces of stone in my urine. This really is amazing. I feel like I was let in on a big secret. Thank you so much for posting this.
5736	94	6703	John from Eau Claire, Wisconsin	2007-03-19 00:00:00	BETTER BUT NOT CURED	2	0	Hello everyone, I am a 24 year old male, who is from Wisconsin, but am currently in Spain teaching English. I had horrible back/side pains but before this I thought I had a UTI. (BTW I was told by urologist that Kidney stones can produce a false positive for a UTI on a urine analysis,) well long story short I have been dealing with these stones (5mm and 6mm ) for 3.5 months now. I have tried everything, short of catheterizing myself with straws duct taped together and sucking them out with a vacuum, so I just mixed the extra virgin olive oil and the fresh lemos together, and I will keep you updated. I hope this works!! Cheers :::gulp gulp:::
5694	94	6662	Angie from Miami, Florida	2007-07-03 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	7/3/07 -- This past Sunday I spent 5 hours in the emergency room with a killer pain that was diagnosed as a kidney stone. I was stunned but not surprised since my dad, brother and nephew have all passed kidney stones more than one time. Nevertheless, it really came out of left field for me. The pain was unbearable but I was relieved to have a diagnosis. My stone they said was approximately 4mm and pretty close to the bladder, so they sent me home to pass it w/ some pain killers. Sunday day came and went, no stone. Monday morning...more meds because the pain began all over again, so I knew the stone was still there. Took more pain killers and decided to surf the web for info. I have 2 small children and can't afford to be bed ridden till the stone decides to pass, so I was ready to try anything that could help me pass the stone. The 2oz olive oil/ 2oz lemon juice formula seemed harmless enough and the positive feedback was overwhelmingly in it's favor, so I tried it but w/ 4oz of lime juice instead. That's all I had available and I was in no condition to run to the store. I decided on more juice simply because I wanted to make sure I chased the olive oil taste away. That was at 4pm, Monday, 7/2/07...before midnight I picked up a small little something in my strainer. I have not taken any pills since Monday morning and I feel like a million bucks. I know my kidney stone was close to being explused but I'd like to think this "formula" helped give it that last push it may have needed. Try it...it can't hurt.
5695	94	6663	mary from Portland, Maine	2007-06-30 00:00:00	NAY	1	0	This did not work, the stone is still there. I have to have it removed by doc. My stone is only 5mm sorry I really find it a bit hard to swallow that a stone any bigger then mine will come out with no pain. I wouldn't belive some of these stories. besides you can't make olive oil cold it solitafies. If you are haveing pain, the stone is already moveing.( on its way out) don't make yourself sick with large amounts of this mix. the two and two won't hurt you, but for a stone that is stuck it won't work. I know with this kind of pain you will try anything but I really hate to see people make them self sick listing to what other people say. Kidney's are not something to mess around with. I did try the two and two but it did not work. Good luck and be careful....
5696	94	6664	Ronald from Seattle, WA	2007-06-26 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Last summer I had a stone attack, and honestly thought I was dying. When they finally put me on a gurney, just moments away from shooting me up with demoral, I blacked out. That is, my eyes were open and I momentarily saw nothing. At this point I demanded loudly to know whether I was dying, because I had never experienced a creepy sensation like this. No one yet knew what was wrong with me, they wouldn't even hazard a guess. A few years ago I had appendicitis. I promise you, I could do that again standing on my head, compared to the otherworldy, indescribable pain of a lodged kidney stone.
5697	94	6665	keith from Vancouver, B.C.	2007-06-25 00:00:00	BETTER BUT NOT CURED	2	0	My left lower back startd hurting, and I assumed it was a kidney stone.It was pretty intense, so I found your site and tried the olive oil and lemon juice remedy.I got pretty nauseus, but got up this morning and no pain. I don t know if I passed the stone or not, but at least I know how to get rid of the pain,and will use the magnesium and b6 remedy below to finish the job, as it does seem more pleasant. I would suggest to anyone if they have a serious problem, why not try all the remedys , one at a time, listed on this site. It seems it would be a much better alternative, and one would probably work.
5698	94	6666	Chris from Fort Worth, Texas	2007-06-24 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	It works! It truely works! I experienced major flank pain on my Left side late night June 21-2007. I knew what it was because I have now had two very large stones (one 14mm with the cage/basket method, and one (12mm with Lithotripsy method) and 4 very small (2 thru 4 mm) stones (feeling like sand burrs come through). On June 22-2007 at about 3 PM I mixed the "FORMULA" in a Larger quantity then called for. I knew my stone was HUGE from the Flank pain so I decided that a big stone needed alot of "FORMULA" I mixed 10oz Cold pressed Olive oil and 10oz of Lemon Juice, followed by 3/4 gallons of water in a 4 hour period (needlessly to say I did not get much sleep that night). Within a few hours I could feel my left kidney (gurgling) processing the stone. I had a little bit of sand like pieces come through in about 6 hours. By the afternoon of June 24-2007 I could feel the stone move however it felt spongey. June 25-2007 same feeling however, it have move into my bladder and into the final canal. Today, June 26-2007 at 9:20 I had to go, and out the stone came, After a close inspection of the stone, it measured about 10mm (no jagged edges) and it was indeed "spongy" soft. I was evident to me that the "FORMULA" works. I will start taking this FORMULA in smaller quantities once a month or every other month as a preventative.

5701	94	6669	Larry from San Diego, California	2007-06-18 00:00:00	BETTER BUT NOT CURED	2	0	I tried the olive oil / lemon juice concoction to try to prevent a ureteroscopy to remove a 6mm stone that was located just outside my kidney. I tried it first on a full stomach and then the next day on an empty stomach. Although I didn't pass the stone, some debris was eliminated during each of the following voids after ingesting the solution. It didn't taste that bad and I did not get sick drinking it on an empty stomach. However, I did burb a little and each burp tasted like olive oil, but it wasn't the end of the world. When the day for my surgery arrived, they found the stone just outside my bladder. It had moved all the way down from my kidney to my bladder without the severe pain that everyone thought I would have. I had flank pain and took Vicodan a couple of times to deal with it, but 600mg Ibuprofen would probably have been sufficient. I would have liked to have passed the stone but I think the juice made the trip easier for me. Good luck to all of you.
5702	94	6670	Dot from Washington, DC	2007-06-07 00:00:00	NAY	1	0	I have a 6 mm. stone in the lowest part of the right kidney. I took 2 oz. each of olive oil and lemon juice, drinking them separately, followed by a glass of water. Three days later, I had terrible pain in the right kidney and a lot of blood in the urine. That continued for nearly a week, and the stone has not come out. It still hurts, but a lot less than at first. I'm afraid to try this again and will go through the lithotripsy isntead.

I was searching for a remedy for sore throat and tried cloves. After sucking/chewing 4-5 cloves in a day, my throat felt MUCH better and the next day it was totally gone!!

5703	94	6671	Marie from Lafayette, Indiana	2007-05-27 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I've had kidney stones before, and will probably continue to have them on and off the rest of my life (because I am /awesome/ like that). I'd never tried a remedy on my own before, because I'd always been on my parents insurance and could easily afford codeiene and a doctor's visit. I've been out of college for three years now, with no health insurance, and a kidney stone decides to rear its nasty head in my right kidney (as usual). I suffered it for a week and a half, through the initial agonizing aching and subsequent inability to urinate more than a tiny bit every 10 minutes or so. And I got fed up--I work two jobs and I can't afford to run to the loo when I need to, or stay home. So I messed around on google, and came across the lemon juice/olive oil treatment. I decided the ingridients were cheap enough to give it a go, and obviously not toxic. I upped the amount (2 oz each) recommended, because I wanted it GONE. Totally worked too. This morning, I peed like I'd never peed before and yah no more kidney stone. I think anyway, because I can't feel it anymore, there's no pressure in my tract, and I can pee uninhibited. A word of caution though--I had a hard time sleeping, and spent five hours thinking I was going to heave my guts up. But yes, thank you all who recommenended olive oil/lemon juice--I love you all!

Went through medical channels, urologist, tests to confirm 8mm stone, and then finall lithotripsy. It worked enough that the stone was dissolved and pieces came out. Calcium oxalate stone. Afterwards, though, I wanted to urinate all the time and had a painful feeling at times in my urethra. Went back to urologist, got an xray, and it seemed as though there was a large fragment left in my ureter. He put me on Flomax for two weeks to relax my bladder. I still had the sensation of needing to urinate a lot, plus no stone had passed. I found this site and read about the olive oil and lemon juice. I tried a smaller dose two nights ago, but nothing. I am approaching another doctor visit, so last night I took more. I did not mix them together, either. I drank the olive oil which, if you get a good brand of extra virgin, can taste good, then the fresh juice of two lemons, then drank a quart of water. This morning, after walking the dog, I passed a large fragment, what I believe was the last fragment. I am normally dubious of many home cures. I believe in Western medicine, but I also believe in organic food, Eastern medicine and lots of other stuff. I'm not pre-disposed, in other words to automatically go for the herbal cure. And this could have been a coincidence, but I believe it is what finally worked here. I am grateful.
5706	94	6674	Terri from Salt Lake City, Utah	2007-05-18 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Monday May 7th had the worse pain ever on my left side lower back. Having had a kidney stone before I knew exactly what the cause was. The pain subsided but returned on Wednesday May 9th with a trip to the ER. I was told yes I had a kidney stone, a 6mm one to be exact. I contacted my uriologist who immediately set up a surgery date for May 17th saying there was now way I would be passing this big a kidney stone. Being that I had already had this type of surgery before I certainly was not looking forward to it again! My grandmother suffers from kidney stones and gave the olive oil & lemon juice remedy. I took 2oz olive oil & the juice of a half of lemon drank that down followed by a 8oz glass of water with the other half of the lemon juice. That was on Thursday May 11th. During the following days I drank water with lots of lemon and then the afternoon before the scheduled surgery I was supposed to pick up my hospital packet and told the nurse I really think I passed the stone. They were hesitant but ordered another scan and were shocked to find out I had passed a 6mm stone on my own! I was overjoyed at not having to have surgery the next morning and swear the combination of olive oil and lemon juice is what did it!

My husband had been suffering with a kidney stone for 3 weeks. 4 trips to the ER, many shots of morophine and oral pain killers still no relief or passing of the stone. I looked up home remedies online and thought we would give it a try. He did the 2 oz of Olive oil and 2 oz of Lemon Juice and chased it with 12 oz of water. He did this at 9 PM and by 11:30 AM he had passed the stone. WHEW!! We will definitely try this first IF it happens again.
5709	94	6677	Muz from Christchurch, New Zealand	2007-05-16 00:00:00	BETTER BUT NOT CURED	2	0	Had excruiating pain in my right flank and ended up with my partner taking me to the Accident and Emergency department at the hospital. After subduing the pain I was sent for X rays and MRI from which they determined I had a 4mm kidney stone. I was told to take the prescibed pain relief and the stone should pass within the next three days. A week later still nothing and the pain killers were not quite doing their job. After googling "kidney stones" I found your site and decided to try 2ozs of lemon juice and 2 ozs of olive oil. I suffer a bit from acid reflux and so had a slight burning in the throat for a while. Then nausea kicked in for a couple of hours. (not a big fan of that either) Later that evening I realised the pain in my side was completely gone. Its been two weeks now and still no pain. I was told to urinate through a strainer to collect any stones to show the urologist and I am continuing to do that but still have nothing to show. Its great to be pain free but I wonder if its still there or been completely dissolved. Anyway thanks for this great remedy - definitely worth trying when your in that much pain.

I went through the horrible pain of passing a kidney stone 4 weeks ago. I was hospitalized for 4days because of an infection and high fever. My doctor put a stint in to help pass the stone, I had that for 3 weeks. Then because that did not work I had lithotripsy done( another stay in the hospital). I went back to my doctor because I had not passed the stone yet. He scheduled me for another proceedure because my stone had not moved at all, even after they had blasted it into pieces, so I started looking on the internet for anything that would help me pass this. I mixed the olive oit cocktail, drank the water and went to the bathroom and there were several pieces of stone!!!!!!!!!! Too bad I didn't know this before my 2 stays in the hospital.

I was suffering with a sinus infection and was on antibiotics, as soon as I drank just one cup of vinegar and water my head cleared up. I have been doing the ACV tea 3 times a day for the last couple of days and I feel great. Thank you so much for putting this valuable information out on the web.

I told my husband that something was wrong because the right side of my back was killing me. After a cat scan, the doctor said I had a small kidney stone. I left the hospital with no pain whatsoever. I have had no pain since sunday, but I tried the lemon juice and olive oil on Tuesday May 8,07. I didn't know if I had already passed the stone since I wasn't in pain or what was going on. It didn't taste bad at all. However it did feel very heavy in my stomach and by 9:00 P.M. I was having diarrehea. I dont think I passed the stone , if there is still one inside of me. I had diarreha twice more this morning and now I feel fine. I am drinking a ton of water. Does anyone know if it is possible that I passed the stone without knowing it?
5712	94	6680	Cindy G. from SF Bay Area, California	2007-05-05 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	UPDATE !! He first took the Oil/Lems Juice " concoction" Wednesday night followed with a huge glass of water. Thanksfully I think the pain meds he was on at the time kept him sleeping instead of feeling nauseated. Then, Thursday morning I gave him just the Lemon Juice.. about 4 ounces worth. I called him from work at 11 am and told me that he had passed one stone and felt another was getting ready to pass. By Thursday afternoon, he had passed it. Coincidence or not, I don't know.. but I will continue this for the next few weeks and see how it works. I am starting to believe. Psst.. by the way.. a lady I work with says that Olive Oil is a natural anti-inflammatory. Shes a health nut and is into all this health stuff. Idon't care what it is.. I just hope it continues to help my husband.

However, I began wondering if my symptoms could be kidney stones. I was in sooo much pain and I also had a constant urgency to urinate. I finally came across this wonderful site. My husband kindly ran to the store and got some fresh lemons and we juiced them and added the olive oil. (Both at 2 oz. each) I took the remedy this afternoon at 3:00 p.m. and only a little over 7 hours later, 10:45 p.m., I began passing some stones. What a RELIEF! It is a true answer to my prayers! Yeah! Now I can get back to life again. I would highly suggest that people suffering from kidney stones give this remedy a try. It was definitely worth it even though I didn't care for the mixture (I took it on an empty stomach). I did experience a little nausea because of this. Thanks again for the invaluable information!
5714	94	6682	Simone from Mackay, Australia	2007-05-03 00:00:00	BETTER BUT NOT CURED	2	0	Since drinking down the mixture of olive oil and lemon juice, I've passed more grit and the pain has definately gone away, I feel perhaps the stone has been dissolved. Have been passing a fair amount of bloody tissue since and come down with fever and chills. Turns out that there is now an infection in the ureter and am on antibiotics, but I'm sure that's from the stone passing, not the oil and juice, although there was a burning sensation down my side a few hours after taking it. But I would go through anything to get rid of these awful stones, and this remedy is always worth a try. Thanks for this great information and here's hoping this remedy works for everyone else too.
5715	94	6683	Oona from Manila, Philippines	2007-05-02 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	hi there! I was found out to have a kidney stone in my right kidney October of 2006. I had a severe UTI then that my OB decided that I should have KUB ultrasound. I was found out to have a 5.4 mm stone. I decided to have a check up with the urologist and he gave me a medicine. After a month of medication it became smaller to 4.2 mm and the doctor gave me additional medicine to be taken for another month. Fortunately the stone became smaller to 3.8 mm. But after the last month of medication, the stone remains at 3.8 mm. The doctor did not give me medicine anymore because he said he already gave me all the possible medicine that can dissolve my stone and he recommended lithotripsy. I told him that I will think about it since I could not afford the treatment. I decided to search the internet for possible natural remedy and thank god that I found this website. April 25 at 9:00 pm I drank the cocktail of 2 0z of lemon juice and 2 oz olive oil. I waited for the stone but I found nothing in my urine. Next I drank the cocktail friday, april 27. But still no stone was found. May 1 I had an appointment with a nephrologist and before that he requested me for a urinalysis. When I went to a laboratory for the urine test, I found out in the cup where I urinated that there are small white particles. I suspect those are the stones. Actually I feel better and I could not wait to have an ultrasound to see if my stone is gone already. I still want to drink another coctail to make sure that my stone is totaly gone. Just a warning to those who wanted to try lemon juice with other oil. Please never combine it with other oil. I tried it with virgin coconut oil and I had severe stomach ache and loss bowel movement. But anyway again I'm thankful for this website because I will not spend money for medicine anymore.

I kept take the suggested 2 oz. olive oil witht he 2 oz. lemon juice every couple of day because I kept getting achy in my left kidney. Stones kept coming, 2 Monday, 2 Friday and 2 Saturday and 1 Sunday.
5717	94	6685	Paul from Milledgeville, GA	2007-04-30 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Lemon Juice & Olive Oil Remedy works! on Saturday 4/21 I awoke at about 3a.m. with the lower back pain from hell. Left kidney felt like an ice pick being jabbed in and out. Popped a pain pill I had and endured the pain until about 9 a.m. when it subsided. The rest of the weekend and the following week I had pain in my groin area from time to time. Nothing like the kidney pain so it was tolerable. Still hadn't passed the stone though. I had been online and ordered a product that I had found . It's called Uriflow , it's expensive but when you're in pain you'll try anything right ? Well after doing that I found this webpage and read the remedy recipe. Sounded too easy and too good to be true but guess what, it TOTALLY WORKED!. Friday 4/27 I read this page and bought the ingrediants on the way home and took it at 7 pm along with about 2 bottles of water. Around 9:30 PM I had the urge to urinate really bad and Bam! out popped a 6 or 7 mm sized stone. Whew what a releif. I suggest to anyone with a stone to give this a try. It's basic ingredients you can buy at the grocery store , what do you have to lose, except a kidney stone.
5754	94	6721	Stacey from Charleston, SC	2006-11-24 00:00:00	BETTER BUT NOT CURED	2	0	ok.. .I am guessing this worked for my pain... but no stone yet.. .I drank the remedy of 2oz Lemon juice well mixed with 2oz Olive Oil...I drank it and began downing my water and I had a sudden rush of hotness over come me... I ran to the sink and puked it all up! Including everything I ate previously... We will see if there was enough digested to pass the stone but if you have a weak stomach, you may puke your guts out! Good luck! Don't let this discourage you... there are a lot of people saying it DOES work... but I guess I have gotten the rough end of it...LOL... Good luck to all of you reading this for I FEEL your pain! These little boogers suck! I hope this works for you!
5718	94	6686	Stu from Philadelphia, PA	2007-04-30 00:00:00	BETTER BUT NOT CURED	2	0	I have had uric acid stones before - 6 to be exact. Each time, they seem to get worse. The last was 2 years ago and lasted about 24 hours until it reached my bladder (it was 5mm) but literally took 3 months before I peed it out. Last Tuesday I started to get one again. It started mild but after several hours got really bad. At the ER, they told me I had 2 stones, a 7mm in the ureter, and an 8mm in the kidney. The thought of drinking that mixture, when the pain starts kicking in and, especially the first 24 hours of this thing would have been impossible. Now, it is Sunday night and that bugger (I'm using a polite term) doesn't feel like it's moved much at all. The pain is in the flank and is a burning, sticking kind of pain (not that initial cramping agony) which only occasionally brings on a wave of nausea. Tomorrow, the urologist will give me a catscan and tell me if it has progressed. I will ask him about this rememdy although I'm sure he was say "Drink ANYTHING". If it works, I will be in your debt forever. The x-ray I took revealed that there are several stones in there on both sides (waiting in the wings). I do NOT want to go throw this again. I lost a week's work. I want to know from the people that used this remedy if the fact that these are uric acid stones would make a difference since the 'cures' are different for calcium stones.
5719	94	6684	Chris from Sequim, WA	2007-04-24 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I would like to give a synopsis of my very recent hideously painful bout with kidney stones. This started at noontime on Thursday, April 19th and escalated very quickly, just like the last bout.
5720	94	6687	Deputydon from Colorado Springs, Colorado	2007-04-22 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Okay, I had nothing to lose. I had been to the Emergency Room twice. Once for the initial diagnosis and the second time for severe pain. I was told that I had a 4mm stone that was passing. After waiting several days and going thru lots of pain, I took matters into my own hands and found your remedy for kidney stones. I went to the store picked up a couple fresh lemons and came home and made the drink with the virgin olive oil. The mixture actually looked worse than it tasted. I read that some people had a hard time keeping it down, but I thought it went down pretty easy. I did chase it with lots of water just to make sure it stayed down. I took the drink at approx. 6:30 p.m. on Saturday the 21 of April. The pain appeared to have lessened somewhat. I went to bed thinking that I maybe would have to try it again in the morning or just give it up because it was not going to work. At approx. 2:10 a.m. I woke up with the urge to urinate. Nothing unusual since I had drank lots of water prior to going to bed. As I was urinating in my doctors provided cup, I heard a plop, and there was my stone. I had no pain as it was coming out, and I was very surprised. I believe the lemon/oil drink helped in releasing my stone. It was only a 4mm, but it was jagged and not very smooth, hence the severe pain. I think this remedy helped. I'm not some crazy person or a person that just wanted to post a positive outcome to get your hopes up. I'm a honest person, and my career is in law enforcement. My email address is not posted because I do not want unsolicited mail. If you want to write me check out my professional website, and get my email address there.

The pain seems to be moving from my back, to my scrotum , to the groin, burning in the penis. ANT SUGGESTIONS?? I tried the coke and asparagus, and it did dissolve a 9mm about 2 yrs ago. But it takes 2-3 hrs of time, and I am on the run lately. Email me if you wish..
5723	94	6690	John from Memphis, Tennessee	2007-04-20 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	First let me begin by saying ,I was very skeptical regarding the lemon juice /olive oil remedy for kidney stones, but like other posters here when in the kind of pain associated with kidney stones one will grasp at anything for the hope of relief. I began with excruciating pain that lasted for 6 to 8 hr periods for 3 days before seeing a doctor. The doctor diagnosed me with kidney stones and sent me for an MRI. The MRI revealed a 8mm stone in the left ureter. When I returned home still in agony I mixed 2oz fresh squeezed lemon juice with 2 oz extra virgin Olive oil as instructed on this site and drank it down. It actually wasn't that bad. I followed it with plenty of water. For the first 48 hrs I had no change , still plenty of pain .At about the 48 hr mark just when I thought it wasn't working for me, the pain disappeared completely. About a few hours later I passed 3 small stones without pain . The next morning I passed another. A follow up appointment with a urologist and a few X-rays a week later (the soonest appointment I could get) confirmed the stone was gone. The doctor was amazed and said I wouldn't have passed a stone that big without knowing it, I told him I passed 4 pieces and he said I was lucky and somehow it must have broken up. I hope I never have the chance to test this cure again however I do think It was the reason for the stone breaking up.

In the past 15 years I have had 3 surgeries for kidney stones. about every five years here we go again!well about a week ago the feeling came back again. pressure in my lower stomach.dam so i went to the internet and looked up kidney stones and vinegar cause id tired it before but it didn't work than so I thought maybe there would be something else I might find for kidney stones.thankyou thank you thank you who ever you are for the website on olive oil and lemon juice remedy for kidney stones!! In the morning i made up a glass of 2 oz extra virgin olive oil and 2oz of lemon juice.it seemed like alot to drink of this stuff but id drink all\\most anything instead of having to go through my doctor visit to tell me to go to a urologist than he told me to get a mri than back to the urologisgt to tell me i needed ultra sound and also the good old trip up the penis to remove one that way too. after 17,000.00 missed time from work and all the doctors visits i felt good. that was 1 year ago.so anyway i drank it and also drank a large glass of water . i didn't eat or drink anything for 3 hours.in that time i urinated a few times and i felt a slight burning which told me fragments were coming out. I was so happy to know it was working at lunch after i eat oatmeal i did feel a little nausea but that went away.now another sign that it worked was now when i urinated the stream was stronger and before it was weak and id have to stand there and wait not anymore! it's a miracle that works thanks again I'm a very happy man!!!!

5727	94	6694	Danny from Raleigh, NC	2007-04-11 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have had several kidney stones over the years and let me start by saying I've never really believed in "home remedies and certainly never have added comments to a website such as this one. However, if my comments help one person to not experience the pain I have had over the years, my simple comments are well worth my time. Monday, I started experiencing the all too familiar pain of another kidney stone. Tuesday,I went to see my friendly Urologist. He said it was good to see me again. I unfortunately DID NOT feel the same. Another darn stone and this time it was the largest I'd had out of a half dozen or so. He said it was a very large stone but "passable". That is when I really knew tough times were ahead. Now, I know about the thought process that indicates most stones pass within 48 hours. Let me assure you that has never happen for me. Last night I figured I had nothing to lose and came across this website. What a blessing. The recipe tasted terrible, but as most of you know, taste is the last of your concerns if you're experiencing kidney stone pain. Anyhow, I passed it this morning at 3:30. It was not nearly as hard as the ones I'd had in he past. I could actually crumbled it between my fingers. Now, I am normally a very strong non believer in these home remedies, but this WORKED. p.s. No I do not work for an olive oil or lemon company (lol). Thank GOD for the lady that shared her home remedy.
5728	94	6695	John from Apple Valley, Calif.	2007-04-11 00:00:00	BETTER BUT NOT CURED	2	0	On April 4th was taken to the ER via ambulance vomiting and in the worst pain ever! I thought I was dying. Six hours and a cat scan later, I was sent home with the knowledge that I was in for a rough time with kidney stones. The pain was unbearable and went on for the entire morning and afternoon of the 5th. The pain meds were little help. My sister googled dissolving kidney stones and came up with this site and forwarded the info to me. I was willing to try anything at this point and cautiously tried it. Within the first hour I felt considerably less pain. I took another dose at bedtime. I slept the whole night through. The next day I took another dose and rested comfortably. By the early evening of the 6th I was able to go on a planned fishing trip weekend (remedy in tow). I spent the entire weekend fishing with only a little discomfort, not enough to stop me from enjoying myself. In fact I only needed Advil twice the whole time. I don't know if or when the stones passed (the doctors didn't give me a strainer) but I am feeleing so much better and the pain is almost non existant! Who would have thought lemons and olive oil could be so GREAT!!!! If you are suffering, you have GOT to try this!!! It works!!!
5729	94	6696	Kevin from Grand Rapids, Michigan	2007-04-09 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I had a kidney stone last year and went to the emergency room only to get sent home and wait for it to pass three days later. I had the stone tested and found out I have Calcium stones. When I felt a sharp pain in my lower back two weeks ago I knew exactly what was happening. I took pain killers for two days and then decided to wait it out. A week and a half went by with no progress, so I started looking on the web for home remedies. I came across this website and went to the store and bought the lemon juice and olive oil. I took it at 9pm last night and at 9:30 this morning I passed a 3mm stone. This remedy worked for me and I would recommend it to any one who is suffering. By the way it only cost $4.00 for the ingredients :) Thanks for such a great website.

I don't have insurance and was desperate for relief. My back pain started dully on Wed 4/4/07 but by Thursday I could hardly walk & Friday I was ready to die. The pain was jolting, shooting, radiating, debilitating, unbearable. Thank God I had hydrocodone 7.5/500mg to somewhat dull the pain-took 4 painkillers Thurs, took 3 Fri & 2 on Sat. Also used ice packs on my back from Wed - Sun. Friday afternoon I started multiple approaches to eliminate what I believe were kidney stones (have a family history) but this was my first experience & I pray the last.

However, I did not think it could do any harm either so, since I was hurting, I gave it a try. It was not unpleasant to drink and did not upset my stomach as some have reported. Unfortunately, it did not move my stone either. Oh well, nothing ventured nothing gained.
5733	94	6700	Chuck from Allendale, Michigan	2007-04-02 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Just last Saturday, March 31, I came accross your website while looking for a remedy for kidney stones. I have been suffering with stones since last Fall. I went through Lithotripsy twice to blast a 14mm. Both times I was given the maximum amount that can be given. Still not enough to make the pieces small enough to pass into the bladder. So, Saturday night I went to the store to pick up the lemons and olive oil. At 9:p.m. I downed the mixture of 2 oz each. Sunday nothing happened so I mixed up another cocktail and drank that by 9:p.m. Here it is on Monday afternoon and at 3:p.m. I passed 2 stones. 30 minutes later passed 2 more stones. Another 30 minutes and passed the biggest stone of the 5. I think that is all that I have. Surgery was scheduled for 2 weeks from today. I am confident that all is well now. As a preventative measure I think I will use this remedy once a month. I am a happy man!

My first mixture with bottled lemon juice helped, but I could tell it wasn't going to do the trick. Eight hours later I drank the mixture again, but this time I used fresh squeezed lemon juice with the olive oil. Two hours later I passed the stone! I've been pain free ever since!

I had ordered Uriflow on a Friday, but it didn't arrive until the following Tuesday. By then, I didn't need it. I found the Olive Oil/Lemon Juice cure online, and decided to try it along with an herbal formual that I found at a health food center. I bought "Stone Buster" manufactured by Herb Pharm and combined that with the oil/lemon mixture. They both tasted FOUL to say the least. But, after starting with the Stone Buster on Saturday and the oil/lemon on Sunday, the stone was passed some time on Monday night. I say some time because I was straining everything that came through (and after all of the water I drank, ALOT came through), but during the overninght, I didn't look each time I went. When I awoke on Tuesday, the little devil was in the strainer. 3mm x 5mm and I did not feel a thing!! Don't know which cure to credit, but I have to say that the oil/lemon treatment had to help. TRY IT!!!

5737	94	6704	Lori from Leesville, LA	2007-03-18 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Wow - I've been plagued with kidney stones since I was 14 years old (now 36)... My husband is in the Air Force, so I've had the opportunity to see many urologists regarding my problem from all over the world. None have ever mentioned this simple remedy - and boy does it ever work for the type of stones I produce!! Last week I passed yet another stone and when I woke up with flank pain this Saturday, I decided to search for a natural remedy - Found this site, tried it last night before I went to bed and "bam"... the pain has moved south and I've been eliminating tiny white shards of stones all morning long. (they are normally brown - I've been searching for some of the old ones I collect to drop in the solution to see what happens, but can't find them). Anyhoo - has anyone tried doing this as a regular regimen to eep the stones at bay - say every week or two?? I'm going to start it every Friday night from here on out and see what happens - I'll be back with more info in a month or two...
5738	94	6705	Geoffrey from Ellicott City, MD	2007-03-08 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I am a 48-year-old male in otherwise outstanding health. I'm an ultrarunner and that could be why I suffered my first bout of kidney stones this past Saturday. Perhaps it was due to chronic dehydration. I awoke Saturday morning to the most extreme pain I have ever experienced. For the next several hours I lay on the floor screaming in pain and vomiting. My wife called my doctor and he said get to the ER. I spent the day there. They medicated me and sent me home with a strainer. I had 2 stones, 2-3 mm in route. Sunday I was in big time pain, the drugs did not do much at all. Monday I improved but was still peeing blood. Desperate to avoid having anything enter my um "works" to alleviate the issue (a man's worst nightmare) I searched the internet and found the 2 oz olive oil, 2 oz lemon juice cure. On Tuesday morning at 10:30 I drank it down. It was not hard to get down at all. I followed it with tons of water with lemon juice. Additionally I followed the protocol found here: http://www.jumpandbump.com/ ' Basically you drink tons of water and wait for the water to build up on top of the stone. Then you lock your legs and hips and jump from a step to a hard landing. Do that twice every 5 minutes for an hour. Wednesday, more lemon water and waiting. Thursday morning, bingo, easy as you please both rocks came out. Coincidence or cure? I don't really care because it worked for me in 48 hours with no pain.

As I experienced having kidney stone attack is quite painful. It happened to me at two in the morning. Thanks to my colleague for driving me to hospital. The attending nurse injected pain remover to ease the excruciating pain. The next day in my x-ray, there we found the culprit of my pain, a stone in my kidney. The doctors asked me which I prefer laser or medicine treatment. I choose the long process of medicine treatment. He gave me three kinds of tablets and capsules. Back to my work, I tried to check from internet the best treatment for kidney stone. Thanks, God I found Earth Clinic and this wonderful cocktail treatment.As soon as I reached our house, immediately I made this 2 OZ OF LEMON JUICE AND 2 OZ OF OLIVE OIL. The next day while I am on duty the stone 07 mm in size passed at around 18 hours after the cocktail treatment. It is great to be healthy again. Thanks God and thanks earth clinic. By the way, my doctor will surely miss my appointment with him.

At 9:00 PM friday night I drank the mixture followed by lots of water (a little more than a liter). Within 2 hours the pain was noticeably lessened. Another dose on Sunday afternoon, and I have been completely pain free! This is an awesome remedy! I have no clue what the olive oil has to do with the success, but this really worked for me. Thank you so much!
5741	94	6708	Jim from Bentonville,  AR	2007-02-19 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have suffered with kidney stones for twenty years. About six months ago I felt another one strike. Those of you that suffer know the pain well and the location based on the pain. I suffered with this pain for almost six months and finally went to the hospital. I found that I had two stones the size of a dime in the left kidney and about a 5mm on the right side that was basically hung before going into the bladder. The doctor scheduled me for surgery with fear that one of the kidneys would get blocked. In desperation, I came home and found this cure using lemon juice and olive oil and thought what do I have to lose. I took the dosage and went into prayer. The next day I once again took the dosage and prayed. That night the stone came out easy as you please. You have to understand that I believe in prayer very much, but felt that God led me to this page. It will work, and you are welcome to e-mail me as I am truly an honest person.

The Doctors always told him that it would probably not ever move and not cause any trouble. A Stag horn in the kidney shoots out horn like arms and fills all the little crevices in the Kidney. They are not going anywhere. Having said that....
5743	94	6710	J.M from San Diego, CA	2007-01-16 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I'm a Believer! Thanks so much for this website. I was afflicted on Christmas Day with excruciating pain in my right side. After being rushed to urgent care I was diagnosed with kidney stones, given some pain meds and a pee strainer and sent home. I was stuck in the bed for the first week. The pain meds don't take away the pain, they just make it barely bearable. After 2 weeks of no change I decided to search for home remedies. I had previously read about apple cider vinegar, and then the olive oil and lemon juice concoction. I decided to try 2 oz of all 3 ingredients. I was desperate! I drank it down in 2 gulps followed by a glass of water and then cranberry juice and went to bed. The next morning the pain was actually bearable without pain meds. Within a few more hours, all the pain was gone. As far as I know I have not passed the stone or stones, but I am pain free! When I went to urgent care they scheduled a ct scan for 4 weeks away; Next week I will go and have it. I don't know if the stone dissolved or just found a nice place to hide. I guess I will find out next week. Thank you thank you thank you for this site!

I searched the web when a friend said he thought he had kidney stones again (prev. had kidney stones 7 yrs. ago). He recognized the symptoms - nausea, vomiting, chills/fever, severe lower back pain. A trip to the ER confirmed what he had thought - yes, kidney stones. After leaving the ER with a RX for pain medication, my friend took the home remedy & called me today (11 hours later) & said he passed the stone!!!! This is such valuable info! I urge anyone reading this to try it for kidney stones!!
5744	94	6711	Drew	2007-01-16 00:00:00	BETTER BUT NOT CURED	2	0	O.K whattup peoples? If you wanna get rid of your kidney stones, let me show you how. First you try the lemon juice and olive oil for about 2 to 3 days, after that mix 2/12 ounces of lemon juice with only a little water,follow with a whole bottle of water. Do that every 2 to 3 hours but make sure you drink one bottle of water an hour.The goal is to drink 10 bottles per day, AND you'll start to see that your urine is cloudy and sandy like so if you see that, that means it's working. The lemon juice helps break down the stones,,it worked for me cause I had a stone on each side and I've done it for about a week now and I just got back from the hospital an hour ago and my doctor told me that I got only one stone left and the other one is almost in my bladder ready to pass....the remedy works but make sure you drink the lemon juice and water until your brain turns into a lemon.(STOCK UP ON LEMON JUICE AND WATER CAUSE YOU'LL NEED IT)!!!!!
5745	94	6712	Shane from Des Moines, Iowa	2007-01-12 00:00:00	BETTER BUT NOT CURED	2	0	I am 38 years old and am going on two weeks with my first kidney stone. And, like others have stated, the pain has been unbearable. When I read the comments on the olive oil/lemon juice remedy, I thought the passing was pure coincidence. My stepfather often said about headaches: If I take aspirin, they go away. If I don't take aspirin, they go away. I wondered if the same was true with kidney stones. About 12 hours ago, I thought I would give it a try. No stones have passed yet, but it did seem to stop the pain (coincidence?). I suffered through some pain today at work and did not have the remedy. Will try again tonight if the pain hits. Meanwhile, I am hoping for the stone to pass. Question for those with multiple stones. My pain has been on the right hand side of my body and a cat scan confirmed the stone. I don't have pain on that side any longer. It may have passed; I don't know. But now I have pain on the left side only. Would it be another stone?

So I get home and I am a little nervous about trying it because so many people said it tasted horrible, but I had to do it, bottoms up. It did not taste too bad to me but I have a strong stomach. I was fine for a while and then about 2 hours later I had to fight the urge to vomit, I usually can keep myself calm enough not to, then I slowly started to feel better, I felt a few little pains in my Kidney through the night but no where near what I had been feeling. I got up this morning, very tired cause I did not sleep too well last night but I have only had a couple little minor flutters in my Kidney and that was this morning, no pain at all now. I am truly AMAZED! I am also so glad I found this site. I have not passed the Stone that I know of but If I do you can be sure that I will be back here to tell about it!! Good luck everyone!

Both are tough things to swallow lol.
5749	94	6716	Andrew from Bergen County, NJ	2006-12-14 00:00:00	NAY	1	0	I tried this mixture of lemon juice & olive oil to alleviate the pain and possibly help pass my stone. Aside from repeating the taste of olive oil continuously for about eight hours, it also made me quite sick to my stomach. I fought off several attempts to heave the whole thing back up. After enduring an entire night of non-stop stomach turbulence, I was rewarded with a very good case of the runs. Not an overall pleasant experience, and more than 34 hours later I still have my stone. Oh, and the pain that evening was later controlled by tylenol with codeine.
5750	94	6717	Aurelie from Toronto, Ontario	2006-11-30 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Hi! all, I'm 18 weeks pregnant, and 9 days ago I was admitted to the hospital with an excruciating in my left flank. I was told I had a 4mm kidney stone. Being pregnant, my husband and I were quite worried about the Tylenol 3 I had been prescribed and worried about how the whole ordeal could affect our baby! As luck would have it, I found your website, and drank the olive oil/lemon juice mix and about 12 hours later, I was peeing little grain of sand and the pain had diminished. 3 days later I drank the mix again thinking the stone would still be in my kidney, and the next morning the pain had vanished. That same day, I was schedule for my second ultrasound, and they checked to see where the stone was located, and it had literally vanished from my system!! Thank Goodness as my baby is one and didn't have to take any pain killers or go through agonizing pain... Don't hesitate to try, it's drinkable, it's natural and it works!! Cheers

Exactly 25 hours later, my stone came out. I really doubted this would work when I read it on your website, but I thought, it certainly couldn't hurt. I was headed for a uteroscopy to have it removed next week. Thank goodness I won't have to have this done. My doctor won't believe me when I tell him. Thank you for all of your inputs.
5758	94	6725	Paula from La Crosse, WI	2006-11-03 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I had heard of this after my last bout with a stone. When I started having pain last night, I googled again for the oil/lemon stuff and came to this site. I sent my husband to the store to get the olive oil and lemon juice. I took it (gross) and about 15 min later still having pain I decided to take a hot shower. --I can't believe people do not recommend that more for the pain. It always gives me instant relief at least for a while. Now a hot pad never worked, but a wet hot rag worked. The hot showers are the best. I believe the moist heat allows the ureter to expand a little. About 15 minutes after that, I went to the bathroom. Not seeing anything, I almost flushed the toilet. Then I saw the stone. It was totally white, Blended right in with the toilet. Maybe that is why people have not seen the stone. They are always dark like a stone and easy to see. I took it out and it broke in two and crumbled and was mushy in my hand. I couldn't believe it. Through the night I felt like crap chills/ sweats/ nausea/ headache and even during the day today. Not sure if it is related or I just ended up with a bug at the same time. Even if these bug symptoms were related to it, I would still recommend it. I just couldn't believe it did that to the stone. It must also be doing it to the many stones still in my kidneys. I just hope these other symptoms go away by tomorrow. Thanks much

I did not have much pain just a gnawing uneasy feeling in the back area. The next day I continued with water. Today at 1:30 in the afternoon, Guess what???, a stone came out! I collected it and it crumbled easily, I guess the lemon juice did it's thing! I will be doing the Lemon Juice thing every few weeks . Tonight before Bed, I will do it again, just in case there are more. WOW, it worked!!

The stone hasn't passed in 24 hours, but the relief of not having agonizing pain was worth the trial! I went from using prescription Tylox to over-the-counter Motrin for pain relief. It felt as though this mixture expedited the travel of the stone.  I would recommend this solution as it is safe, inexpensive and effective. Strangely I was watching a cooking show that used these two ingredients to make a simple salad dressing!

Finally had a xray a few days ago and determine it. IT was in the tube and trying to go into the bladder. Dr. wanted to do what they normally do because he said it was to big to past on my own BUT I was willing to try anything. And praise the LORD the lemon juice and olive oil worked (2oz.lemon juice and 2oz. olive oil). I took a dose on Monday night the 16th and took one when I got up this morning and then this evening and at 7:30 I passed the thing.

I happened to find this site three weeks ago, and then two weeks ago my ex-husband called me from the emergency room to tell me he had a kidney stone that was too large to pass. He filled his prescription for pain pills and scheduled the surgery for last week, knowing what it involved, because he's had them eight or nine times in the past. I sent him a link to the testimonies on your site and he wrote back that it sounded terrible. I replied, "As terrible as having surgery?" I didn't hear anything more from him and then saw him yesterday at a function for my son. I asked if he had the surgery and he said, "No, I went in for an exam and one more xray before scheduling the surgery and the doctor couldn't find anything. It's gone." I'm so thrilled that this worked for him and I can't wait to tell everyone about it. I'm just curious if he passed them already w/o realizing it? That would seem odd to me, but I've never had these things (knock on wood). At any rate, mark one more person down in the Yay column.

Was referred to urologist. 2 days before going there, I drank the horrible tasting (gagging, really) concoction of 2oz lemon juice and 2oz olive oil. Within a day, my blood in urine was gone, along with almost all of the pain! Urologist said only one stone left, a big one, and will get another xray in 2 weeks to check on it. Needless to say, I will be gagging down the concoction every day until that appointment. I also noticed TODAY that my urine has gravel in it-the damned stones disintegrated! Thanks again for the cure. Beats lithotripsy, even the new one with no water/tub!

I started getting pains on Saturday morning and by Saturday night I was thinking oh brother here we go again!!!!! By 2 a.m. I was surfing the internet and paying people for "Miracle Cures". By Sunday morning I was fatigued and worn out but still trying to avoid the E.R. and make it till Monday morning to see my doctor. I gave the internet one more try looking for home remedies you didn't have to pay for and stumbled across this web page. I drank the potion at 9 pm and by 9:20 all pain had disappeared and I was one happy camper again!!!! It is now the next day and the stone has not passed but there is still no pain!! Thank you for this web page and advice. I will be trying other remedies I found here also.

5769	94	6735	Jesse from Pinellas Park, FL	2006-09-13 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Greetings to all. I just wanted to comment on the Lemon Juice and Olive Oil remedy for Kidney Stones. I had, not so long ago, my first experience with kidney stones with a 5-7cm stone. As big headed as I am, I didn't know what was going on, or go to the hospital until it had already passed out of my kidney and into my ureter, which dismayed the hospital. Too late for a stint, should have been too big to pass, lucky for me it broke up into a few smaller pieces. Now, I had two major episodes during this period, one while I was at work which was...well, let's just say I've been hurt in almost any way you can think of, so home remedies aren't my thing. The first episode put me on my knee's in my workplace restroom, completely unexpected. But that didn't stop it, it continued when I went home for almost a day. Sweating, tears and agony even with medications to ease my pain. I looked up this remedy, said what the heck, every time I felt the pains in the groin area, I took the 4 ounces (2 Lemon Juice, 2 Olive Oil) while holding my nose, twice. By the morning, scared to attempt to use the restroom knowing I was in for more pain, I bit the bullet and did my business. Low and behold, even though the rest were smaller, they were plentiful (half an pencil eraser tip or less). I'm not going to say FOR SURE that this worked; however, I will say, whatever MAY help, DO IT! Even my doctor was wowed to hear that it may have helped and actually gave it some thought, the oil coats and the lemon juice helps break the stone down as well as a neutralizer. I hope this helps others and I hope you all feel better!

As of 11:00 PM EST only 5 hours after drinking the lemon juice and olive oil he passed the stone. They were planning on putting him in the hospital and removing it. It works!! It really works!! Praise The Lord!! The stone is about 7mm.

I have have kidney stones for "ever" it seems like they mainly hurt on my right, after several times to the hospital for treatment and a lithotripsoy, it seemed endless well in Feb. I thought my kidneys were on another spell so.. off to the hospital, well.. it was my appendix. I had emergency surgery for that and my kidneys never hurt anymore so.. of course I thought it was my appendix and not my kidneys. then last week my left side starting hurting, so.. I started crying cause I didn't want that pain anymore. I read this and tried it and within 10 min. I don't hurt anymore!!! I haven't passed the stone yet but I am so convinced that I will. I was told they are 7mm.
5774	94	6740	David from Sun City, FL	2006-08-06 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I started having lower-right back pain a couple of weeks ago. I knew it was a possible kidney stone as I had a couple of them about 15 years ago when I was in my early twenties. I quickly went to my doctor as I knew the pain would rapidly increase. The pain was almost unbearable by the time I got a pain shot. He prescribed some Percocet (pain pills) and some Ibuprofen and sent me home. I was glad to get some pain medicine because I thought I would just go home and pass the stone. That was what happened with both of my stones that I passed 15 years ago. Unfortunately, it wasn't going to be that easy this time. So for the next week I would have severe pain for about a day and a half and then the pain would stop for another day and a half and then the cycle would repeat. I tried the 'jump and bump' method of passing stones. This is where you jump 2-4 inches and land with your legs locked and it kind of jars your body to try and get the stone to drop. I probably jumped so much that I am now probably a few inches shorter. Well this didn't work. So I went back to the doctor and got an ultrasound and an IVP scan. This is where they inject you with a dye and take a bunch of x-rays. The results showed everything was normal (no stones!). The doctor was surprised that everything was ok so he scheduled me to get a CT scan thinking the pain might be something behind the kidney. That night I did some more research on 'right flank pain' and found this site. I saw the 2oz lemon juice/olive oil recipe and decided to try it. I got some lemons and squeezed them into a measuring cup and got about 1/2 cup. Since I needed to use the same amount of olive oil, that would make a whole cup of this stuff to drink. I didn't think I drink all of that and keep it down so I used a 1/4 cup of each. It actually didn't taste bad. It just makes your lips feel weird (oily). I chased it with a bottle of water. After after about 15 minutes I actually felt a tingling feeling in my right lower flank. At the time I thought it must just be my imagination. I drank this in the afternoon. The next day no stones came out. But the following morning I passed a huge stone 9-10mm that had some very sharp crystalline formations attached to it. I was so happy. I then canceled my CT scan and I can't wait to show my doctor. I am going to get my stone analyzed so I will know what type it is but I think the best thing is to drink more water every day. Many thanks to this site. I wish I had tried this a week earlier.
5775	94	6741	Anthony from Middle Village, NY	2006-07-28 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	5 days while at work I had gotten a sharp pain in my lower back and left side just under my rib cage. The pain was enormous. I thought that I had gas and drank a can of ginger ale. The pain did go away for about 2 hours. Later that night I had gotten a bad attack. I stuffed myself with gas x and mylanta and suffered all night. The next morning i woke feeling like i was hit by a truck but had no pain in my back or side. My family members suggested that maybe I had a kidney stone, but i had no pain. Needless to say later night I found myself in the emergency room. The pain was unbearable. When i entered they instantly said kidney stone. Well they were right. They did a cat scan and said it was a 4 mm and it was in a good position and that i should pass it soon. Well soon felt like an eternity. The pain was so bad that i was going out of my mind. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't sit down, I couldn't lay down. Every time i drank water or cranberry juice the pain would get worse. My stomach would blow up, I would then urinate followed by a pulsating stabbing in my whole left side. Well anyone who is going through this knows what I am talking about. When I woke up with lots of blood in my urine I went to the doctors office. I told him that percasets were not working so he gave me vicadine but nothing relieved the pain. Thank God my brother stumbled across this web site. When I read all the good reviews I figured there was nothing I could lose. Last night at 1 am I felt the pain coming on strong. I then mixed 2 ounces of lemon juice and 2 ounce of olive oil. I was scared it would make the pain worse but it didn't. I drank it quickly followed by a large glass of water. I was surprised that the taste wasn't bad at all and it wasn't as thick as I anticipated. I was also loaded up on pain killers just in case. Within minutes of drinking this I felt almost a soothing of my side. I was still in much discomfort for most of the night. Finally at 6 am I fell asleep. 1 hour later at 7 am I woke and felt like I had to go to the bathroom but it also felt like something was trying to come out. I rushed to bathroom and it just slipped out. No pain.. NO PAIN... NO MORE PAIN. It was a sharp little thing mixed with some blood. The pain was gone. For anyone going through this try, it immediately 2 ounce lemon juice mixed with 2 ounces of olive oil. When you feel the pain drink it fast followed by a full glass of water. Within 6 hours my pain was gone. I don't know why the doctors don't tell you to do this. I guess they just want to make some money.

I've never experienced such sharp burning and sore pain like that before. I hate spicy foods, but a few sprinkles of cayenne pepper in some hot water and just one sip helped immediately! ...3 shakes of pepper to one cup water.

The shock of such a high bill for not even two hours work which didn't even eliminate the problem was about as bad as the excruciating pain. I luckily found your site online and thought, "What the hey? It isn't poisonous, so I'll give it a try" The next day I was in even worse pain but at least I could feel that the stone was moving. The pain completely stopped, and the following day, without any pain at all, I passed the stone. End of story. So put me down in the Yes It Works column!! And thank you for sharing your cure.
5777	94	6743	Frank from Hershey, PA	2006-07-22 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I passed a kidney stone 20 hours after drinking the mixture of 2 ounces each of lemon juice and olive oil followed by a large glass of water. I started having kidney stone pain at 1:00 a.m. Thursday. The pain was extremely severe all day Friday. My wife found your web site with the #1 remedy for lemon juice and olive oil. I was in so much pain I immediately tried the remedy at 8:40 pm on Friday. Within 1/2 hour my pain subsided and I had no pain on Saturday. At 4:10 pm Saturday, I passed a kidney stone the size of a small peppercorn. I have had kidney stones twice before and it took the usual week and a half to pass them. I am definitely going to use this remedy if I experience any more kidney stones in the future. THANKS FOR YOUR WEB SITE.

I was discharged and instructed to drink massive quantities of water and take Ibuprofen as needed as the stone could take anywhere from 1 day to 1 month to pass. I scheduled a follow up appointment with Urologist ("earliest appointment" 7/11). Needless to say; the pain and discomfort was unbearable. On 7/03 I found this website and decided to try the lemon juice/olive oil. I drank the mixture at 7 p.m. followed by a large glass of water. At 10 a.m. today; I passed not one, but TWO stones. Happy Independence Day!!!!! And yes; I Believe!

Dealt with it for 24 hours, I called a friend of mine (Charlotte) for advice on Sunday morning, she told me about the lemon juice and olive oil remedy she had read on Earth Clinic web. I immediately went to the kitchen and drank the lemon juice and then drank the olive oil and water. 10 hours later the stone/stones dissolved and I was able to pass them. Thanks to Earth Clinic and my friend (Charlotte) for the cure!!!! God Bless you both.

Whipped together, it didn't taste too bad at all. I repeated dose again in 24 hours. It's been 15 hours since my last dose, and the stone is still with me. I'm going to try tea brewed from a plant called Chamberbitter.
5781	94	6747	Rob from Ewa Beach, HI	2006-05-30 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	In the past 18 yrs, I've passed well over 100 uric acid kidney stones. I've had J stents placed in me 3 times and lithotrisy once. I pass most of my stones without incident, but there are many that are stubborn and the pain is relentless for days, weeks and months at a time. This most recent episode brought me online once again looking for a remedy. Well I ran into this site where olive oil and lemon juice is recommended and I had to give it a try because I have nothing else to lose. The jury's still out because I haven't passed the stone yet, but if it does pass within the time other have, I'll be very happy.
5782	94	6748	Angie from Indianapolis	2006-05-20 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	On Monday my husband called me at work and said that he had a horrible pain in his back. He went to the doctor and was told that it was most likely a kidney stone, the doctor gave him some pain killers and told him to drink lots of water and it would go away some time in the next two weeks. For three days my husband laid in the bed in a drug induced sleep because that was the only was he could stand the pain. On the fourth day I went to my computer and did a search engine for kidney stones and found this site. My husband was willing to try anything to get rid of the pain. He drank the olive oil and lemon juice about 6:00pm on Thursday and by 6:00am on Friday he had passed the stone. This not only saved my husband's sanity but mine as well. THANKS!!!

5784	94	6750	Isabel from Miami, FL	2006-02-04 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	For the last 6 months I've had flank pains, Nausea, blood in my urine, etc. Three weeks ago, I went to my Dr. who diagnosed me with a urinary cyst and last week another said I had IBS (Irritable Bowl syndrome). That same day I ended up in the hospital because the "attacks" had become consistent and I could no longer tolerate the pain. My suspicions were confirmed, they told me I had a 4 mm stone in my left kidney. At 19 I've dealt with cancer and cysts on my ovaries that flare up during menstruation, the last thing I needed was kidney problems. I was discharged from the hospital WITH the stone because I didn't have insurance. I didn't know what to do or when the stone was going to come out so at this point I knew I'd have to take it into my own hands, I went on the web and discovered the WONDERFUL REMEDY # 1! It REALLY WORKED Thank you, Cyndi!!! It was 12 am and out of desperation I prepared the remedy, it didn't taste so bad but it was hard to keep down. 9am I had a sharp pain during urination, I chickened out and ran for my percosets because I knew it was coming. I held off urinating till about 11:30 and sat in a tub of hot water were I noticeably released the stone! I don't know if passing it would have been painless without the pain killer, but I know within 9 hours I was ready to let that sucker go. I totally recommend this, it's inexpensive and in the comfort of your own home. Try it, it just might end your suffering. Good luck!

I was in so much pain and could barely function. I had a 4 mm stone between my kidney and bladder in my ureter. I tried taking flomax my doctor gave me which did nothing. I read all the posts on the site and decided I had nothing to lose. I did the lemon and olive oil. I drank apple cider vinegar numerous times a day and I took capsules filled with chanca piedra. My stone came out 3 days after trying these remedies. I thank everyone who posted their experiences. I was really not a believer but I stuck to it and here I am, feeling just as I did the day before dec 26. Stick to it. It will all be worth it :)

I had killer man flu (the worst kind) with a sore throat that felt like swallowing broken glass. I tried all remedies from the pharmacy but none of them worked longer than a couple of minutes at most. The cayenne pepper worked almost immediately however. Try it - it works!!

Last time the specialist by cat-scan said I had 3 the size of 50 cent piece. Scheduled me for surgery or the water bath deal on Tues. I left hosp on a Tues. so only had a week to work on dissolving. I drank Lemon juice water, & drank extra water. I also added a tiny bit of baking soda to help sweeten our hard water to get more down. My Cat-scan on Tues showed no stones at all. Dr said to take Magnesium and would never need to see him again. Have tried both Magnesium and Lemon juice since and now been 4 yrs since my last bout with stones. Thanks for the great information.

I mixed the concotion of 2 ounces of lemon juice & 2 ounces of olive oil (which I worked out to be 2 tablespoons of each; 1 oz = 1 tablespoon). Mixed that up and drank it at 11 pm on Saturday night. Then, I started TRYING to drink 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar (ACV) with water. YUK!! Instead I diluted 1 tablesoon of ACV in 8 oz of water and drank that. Then did another tablespoon with another 8 oz. That helped to pass it. Drank lots of crystal light and cranberry juice. Last but not least, I went to grocery store and found (of all things) Apple Cider VInegar tablets!!!! bought those and took some of those.

Doctors decided his body was creating calcium stones. Instead of prescribing chemicals, his doctor suggested he drink lemonade on a daily basis. The citric acid prevents the calcium from forming into a stone. He has not had another kidney stone in two years. The solution is 1/4 cup lemon juice in 2 liters of water.

I started out with one a year and then about three years ago I heard that drinking 3 ozs of lemon juice (fresh squeezed) per day. I now pass one stone every 2 months. What a big relief. It seems to prevent new stones from forming but doesn't seem to be eliminating any existing stones. At lease what I can tell from my CAT Scans. I hope this info helps at least one person out there.

I was not real thrilled by the thought of drinking olive oil, so I tried just the lemon juice to start.  I guessed the olive oil was to make things a little slippery.  I've had four bouts with kidney stones over the last 10 years - all had to be lithotripsied.  I took 2 ounces of lemon juice at 3:00pm and then at 9:00pm.  The next day I felt the stone move, I repeated the processes and began to pass sand like pieces (indicative that the lemon juice may have broken the stone up).  A day later the stone passed with VERY little pain.  Next time, I'll brave up and try the olive oil too.

One night, I juiced 12 fresh lemons and drank the juice straight. I also took the PL tabs (which a natural Chiropractor said would remove the sharp edges of the stone). After one month, a CT scan showed the stone had shrunken from 7mm to 3mm!

My toenails are looking better. I spent about $450 having them lasered 2 years ago and that made them better, but in the process of filing them down, the assistant infected 2 other toes which weren't covered. External soaking and the internal antifungal remedies are the best option for the long term. Good luck to everyone out there treating this menace.

5799	95	6765	John from Perth, Australia	2007-02-08 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I think that alkalizing had the biggest affect on curing my nail fungus. I undertook a number of means to alkalize. That included virgin coconut oil, olive leaf extract, alkalized water, alkaline foods, zeolite, heavy metal detox, etc. I also found that wearing a poultice of zeolite powder and cayenne pepper also has good healing properties. I would often soak my feed in zeolite and acidic water. And after I put my socks on, I would soak some coconut oil and essential oils into the sock just above the nail. But I think the ultimate cause is being too acidic (I had candida too). I have now raised my pH to over 7.0 - up from less than 5.0 a few months ago. My ORP has changed from -ve 20 mV to close to -ve 200 mV. From what I have read, fungus can't exist in an alkaline body.
5800	95	6766	Andre from London, UK	2008-07-28 00:00:00	BETTER BUT NOT CURED	2	0	Ailment: Nail Fungus infection Condition: semi-advanced (bed nail of two of my toes is partially damaged) Treatment stage: beginning (started 4 days ago) Diet: I completely eliminated refined sugars and started eating more fruits and vegetables. Remedy used: on the 1st day, I applied (every 2 hours) a mix of the following: apple cider vinegar and tea tree oil on cotton pads. Noticed some slight improvement, but when I stepped out, there still was an annoying itch. On the 2nd day, I added Vicks Vaporub and poured some urine on the infected area. Applying Vicks before wearing socks and shoes got rid of the itching. On the 3rd day, I added honey (applied topically for 20 minutes) followed by washing the feet with antibacterial soap under very hot water (as hot as I could bear) followed by alternate applications of hydrogen peroxide (pharmacy only had 6% solution), lavender, cinnamon leaf and Eucalyptus essential oils (diluted with apple cider vinegar on cotton pads). I also started drinking 1 teaspoon of baking soda mixed in 1 cup of water (on an empty stomach last night before sleeping and this morning upon waking up). I am glad to say the annoying itching is completely gone. The color of my two infected nails are yellowish. The only place still itching this morning was on the lower part of my toes (bottom part that touches the floor when I walk) - which is the only place I did not concentrate any treatment as it was much easier to keep the cotton pads on the top part of my foot when seating on the couch and watching tv than the bottom part. So what I did this morning was spread a generous amount of Thai Red Curry Paste on all the infected area and keep everything sealed with transparent plastic food wrap. It seems to be working great. The itching is completely gone. Today, I will start applying virgin coconut oil (as well as eating 2 tea spoons daily) + peppermint and rosemary essential oils applied topically. I will also start a detox program along with a gentle exercise program in order to strengthen my immune system. I'll keep you guys updated on my progress :)

My nails are dark on most of my toes and it has since started to affect my fingernails. I have used everything you can name including the lamisil pills. Nothing has worked. I have been surfing the internet trying to find a remedy for this horrible fungus. I have started using the ACV for about 2 weeks now and have no signs of the fungus leaving my toenails. I have however seen some sign on my fingernails. I will definitely be signing in from week to week with an update. Some of the comments and feedback I have read from others is leaving me hopeful that I will be able to see some signs of healthier clearer nails by spring.

I read about using vinegar and he gave it a try since nothing worked including doctor prescribed meds. Its been one month and we see a big difference. Pink, clean nails are 1/4 to 1/2 grown in. He did clip and file his nails tp prep them. We read you can use regular white vinegar, doesnt have to be apple cider vinegar. The white does not discolor the nail!! He soaks feet in tub of vinegar twice a day for ten minutes and changes it once every 7-10 days. Cured athletes foot immediately. Definitely worth a try.

I quite going last year to the salon. I have been doing my own nails. I cut them really short and I cut off as much as the fungus as I could. I have been spraying ACV on my nails 2 times a day. They are so much better. I can now put on nail polish and I keep spraying my toe nails daily. I feel you never really get rid of the fungus, but you just keep it under control with the ACV. I went to the DR, he said they give you the fungus and then they sell you something to get rid of it. He also said they use the same water in the spas as they don't disinfect it after every customer and they also use the same polish so the fungus goes from person to person.

5807	95	6773	Mia from Lyons, Ny	2011-10-30 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	After reading posts on Earth Clinic I decided to try the ACV remedy for a big toe-toe nail that had thickened, had about 1/2 of the toe nail separate/lifted from the nail bed and which had been curling inward badly for a period of about nine years. I decided to become aggressive in fighting it because I saw it start in the big toe on my other foot as well. I figured if I didn't stop it now all my toes would be affected so I began an aggressive fight after reading several posts.

It's just a wee small growth so far, but definitely can see the difference. I was surprised to see this today as I have also tried various natural topical treatments without much success. Plus, the toenail was so much easier to trim... softer nail, although my fingernails are strong and growing fast and the ridges are minimizing as well.

In the past I had taken tablets for six months but it didn't clear it up. It was also starting to affect my other big toe. After taking the apple cider vinegar for about three months (with bicarb soda) (2 tablespoons Apple Cider Vinegar with 1/4 tsp bicarb) the toe nail fungus is now totally gone. It took three months but you could see it clearing as the nail grew.
5810	95	6776	Jean from Charlotte, Sc	2010-11-15 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I began using ACV on my toenails back in June 2010. I have four toenails on my left foot that have been infected since 2002. I poured straight ACV into a small plastic tub and would soak my foot at least once a day (sometimes twice) for 10-20 minutes. I didn't mind the discoloration. Not like anyone was seeing my toenails anyhow. I first started noticing a difference about six weeks later. I could see the base of one of the nails was looking thinner. Unfortunately I took some time off from doing this because I had a baby. But I hadn't even realized that my pinky toenail is completely healed as of November 2010! I honestly didn't think it would work because that particular nail was so thick. But I am shocked and thrilled to say that ACV really worked! I wish I would have known this eight years ago! I could have saved a lot of money instead of trying all those over the counter creams. I'm now looking forward to possibly wearing sandals again next summer!

It was so bad, I did not even want to eat, or yawn. So i tried the Cayenne remedy before i went to bed, i woke up in the morning and about 95% of the pain was GONE. I was so happy, this is great...thanks!
5811	95	6777	Me from Fremont, Ca	2010-11-13 00:00:00	BETTER BUT NOT CURED	2	0	I have had varying degrees of athlete's foot for the last 20 years. More recently toenail fungus has also developed. Having had success using ACV to remove moles I tried it topically for my foot issues. Treatment was as follows: Nightly wetting of my feet with ACV in a bowl. I only did this for two three nights for about 20 minutes and reduced the itching, burning and pealing dramatically. It has returned since then and has each time been alleviated with the same treatment. I have never been consistent enough to do it every night for six or seven days in a row which I believe would completely eliminate it. The ACV has also positively affected the toenail fungus in stopping the yellowing, curling and peeling. I believe with more commitment to ACV treatment mine could be completely healed.
5812	95	6778	Tony from Mammoth Lakes, California	2010-04-13 00:00:00	BETTER BUT NOT CURED	2	0	Many thanks to this site, and the individual posts - especially apple cider vinegar & emphasis on soaking. Both are working extremely well these last 2 - 3 weeks. My big toe nail had turned "white" with thickening of the nail, over some three years. Also, the other nails began to "whiten." I tried two over the counter brands, little to no progress.
5813	95	6779	John from Dallas, Georgia, Usa	2009-10-13 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I started the straight organic ACV soak for my athletes foot (moccasin type) and toenail fungus after trying everything that is sold over the counter as well as one of the liver type pills to get rid of the fungus. Nothing worked. I had this foot fungus for at least 10 years, and I thought I was doomed to have this for the rest of my life until I found the EC website and decided to try soaking my feet in the organic ACV. I used it twice a day for three weeks and my atheletes foot has disappeared and I can see the new clear/white toenail growing in behind the thick/yellow one. Incredible stuff!
5814	95	6780	Enaks from New Rochelle, Ny	2009-09-15 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I tried many different home remedies and prescription meds. Nothing worked. Then I came across Dr. Walt Stoll website and his vinegar treatment. Basically two drops of vinegar at the base of each toenail, twice a day. YOU MUST BE PATIENT. This cure takes a long time to work as it protects the NEW nail growth from getting the fungus. The fungus you already have on your nails must GROW out. So this treatment takes a long time and you must not miss an application. I have done this vinegar treatment twice a day since the end of Oct 2008 and it works. I am so happy and I have nice nails again! Don't get discouraged, it's a slow process. It takes about 30 seconds for each treatment, twice a day, for a total of one minute a day. Before that I was soaking my feet in mouthwash, used vapor rub, tea tree oil, prescription meds, light therapy, etc. I was walking around worried that someone would smell my vapor rub on my feet. ugh! I want to spread the word that vinegar works!! I applied mine after my shower, sat on the floor, dried my feet, used eyedropper and dripped vinegar on cotton swab to swish the vinegar around on the nail. Just a couple of drops each nail, then let them air dry. I also used some cheap foot powder to keep my feet dry for the day. In the evening I used the vinegar again, but not powder. My nails are CLEAR after 11 months, the time flies, and after a few months you will begin to see the new growth. I've been wearing flip-flops the past few months! I hope you all try it.
5815	95	6781	Thankful  from Gurnee, Illinois	2009-09-11 00:00:00	BETTER BUT NOT CURED	2	0	I am in awe of the power of something as simple as apple cider vinegar. Two years ago I dropped a hairdryer on my right big toe. Apparently this was enough to cause an interruption in the nail bed where fungi developed. It started deceptively slowly with just a thin white strip on the side of the nail that was barely noticeable. My podiatrist didn't seem particularly concerned about it, so neither was I. Besides, I typically wear nail polish and didn't have to look at it. However, at the beginning of this week I took my nail polish off and all the sudden I was the creature from the black lagoon! Ewwwwwwwww!!!!!! Approximately 80% of my nail was funkified with yellow and white globules, bumpy, thick and just gross. I have never suffered with anything like this in my life so I was freaked out big time. I knew there is absolutely no way I could take another prescription like lamisil because I take so many drugs for other more serious conditions. My poor liver is stressed as it is so I went to the internet in desperate need of help from the homeopathic community. Thank God for websites like this one! I soaked my infected toe in full strength apple cider vinegar for 3 days equaling 30 minutes in the morning and 30 minutes at night. I saturated a piece of toilet paper with the ACV and just laid in on the nail while I watched tv. In just six treatments the infected part of my toenail fell off this afternoon with no pain whatsoever. Under the nail was the grossest wet sawdust-like substance I have ever seen. I can hardly believe the ACV worked so quickly to eradicate the ick. If someone would have told me that it would work this quickly I never would have believed it after everything I have read. At this point, my plan going forward is to use a spray bottle to apply the ACV after I shower and then apply tea tree oil for a fungus killing antiseptic while also using an over the counter fungal care you paint on before bed. I know it will take months for the nail to grow back, but I feel hopeful that I can put this behind me. At least now I can see a healthy pink nail bed which I absolutely will NOT be covering with nail polish. Any additional suggestions in how to proceed would be much appreciated. A big thanks to everyone for posting and sharing.
5816	95	6782	Suzann from Titusville, NJ	2009-07-02 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I learned about ACV curing fungus through this website. I was desparate to try anything since I wasn't given a prescription of sorts for the fungus by my doctor. My three toes, especially big toes, were humiliating ugly and down right embarassing. Since February I have put on ACV in the morning and at night. Voila! My big toe lost it's nail and now a new nail without fungus is there. My other toe completely cleared up. My third toe is 90% better. So...I am a true believe in ACV. I hope someone can use my success story to help "ugly" feet and horrible toes. Now I can wear sandals again!! Suzann
5817	95	6783	Angela from Te Kauwhata, New Zealand	2009-05-06 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Having suffered with a horrible, unsightly, fungus ridden big toenail for many years I was delighted to find this site which offered natural remedies to cure the problem. I had previously taken lamisal tablets to rid the problem. This left me with an upset stomach. After weeks of taking the medication I couldn't bare the side effects of it any longer and stopped taking it. The fungus quickly appeared again. After all that I have found Apple Cidar Vinegar was the answer. I mixed around 1/4 cup of ACV with enough water to place my big toe in. I soaked the toe morning and night in this mixture. I then applied Lamisal cream under the toenail. I also heeded someone elses advice not to put nail polish on the toe as it allows the fungus a lovely dark environment to thrive in. To cut a long story short, my perserverance paid off and I am thrilled to say that my big toenail is now completely fungus free. Thank you ACV and Earth Clinic!
5841	96	6807	Debbie from Clinton, Iowa Usa	2011-02-28 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have had sinus problems for a long time. Kept me up at night due to barely being able to breath through my nostrils. Came across Earth Clinic on accident and read about Apple Cidar Vinegar ( I have it in my kitcen) in regards to your sinuses, I read about how some people are mixing it with 8 oz of water and 2 tblsp of Honey. I thought I would try it right then and there, and viola, in less than 6 minutes I could breath through my nose with out feeling like I was breathing through a pin hole!!! I slept all night long, and felt rested the next day. I mixed it up again, as I felt my sinus starting to revert back to where they were, and now I'm cleared up again. It, for me, lasted well over 24 hours....
5818	95	6784	Bill from St. Louis, MO, USA	2009-02-02 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	My lady friend developed a severe case of some type of yeast or fungus overgrowth. It began as a red area under one breast, and soon spread to both breasts, upper chest, stomach and groin area. I suspect a recent injection of steroids (to relieve poison ivy) to be the cause, but that is only speculation. This rash was severe. She was Dr. prescribed a cream and then a powder-- with little effect. I recommended the Apple Cider Vinegar Cure, along with making sure the affected area stayed clean and dry. We applied (again, use only), organic, unfiltered, non-pasteurized Apple Cider Vinegar. She applied the ACV directly to the affected area. It is important to note that applying the ACV to a severe rash is Very Painful! I suggest that if you cannot tolerate the pain, you might start with a diluted (50%?) mixture until some of the "rawness" disappears. RESULTS: 100 Percent CURE! Absolutely amazing. She continued the application for about two weeks, with results beginning immediately. Her skin dried completely, the rash and finally the redness disappeared. Thank You Earthclinic, Thank You Ted!
5819	95	6785	Sam from Scipio, IN	2008-11-18 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	After reading about using apple cider vinegar to cure toenail fungus, I decided to give it a try. Not being a patient person, & wanting it GONE ASAP, I applied ACV relentlessly. I dabbed it on morning & night, as well as soaked a cotton ball with ACV, placed it on the nail, & wrapped a strip of tape around it to keep it on the fungus during the day. Sometimes I wore old socks & poured the ACV directly on the socks over the affected toes. The pressure of my shoes kept the vinegary sock in contact with the fungus all the time. Let me just say this - ACV works! In less than a month, I have a healthy pink toenail.

We taped small pieces of banana peel to each wart every night and two are gone, two are getting much smaller, so I'm positive they will disappear. I can't remember how long it has taken, but I would guess at least 1 month. We would forget several nights too.

5823	95	6789	Linda from Clyde, Texas	2008-02-07 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I've used ACV for many problems including fungal infections. When my son came back from Iraq he had a horrible case of athletes foot. I used 1 cup ACV and distilled water as a foot soak and the infection cleared up completely. He only needed to do the foot soak 1 night. Also, I developed that horrible toenail fungus like my mother had...thick yellow nails with a flaky exudate underneath...I started soaking my toenails in ACV straight from the bottle. After a 10 minute soak, I would use a q-tip and get the ACV up under the nail. Within a week, I had healthy growth of my nails. Now they are completely normal. The prescription for this was $600 which I couldn't afford. The ACV was $3.95 and I only had to use a shot glass of it every night for a week to clear up the problem. Once new growth was healthy, I stopped the toe soaks and have not had to use it again.

A doctor friend of mine advised that soaking the nails in ACV every day would eventually kill the fungus. He said it would take time but be patient. I started soaking my fingernails for 15 minutes every day a year ago. All of my nails have SLOWLY grown out healthy except the tip of one nail is almost healed. It has been a slow process, but it works - with no meds!

5826	95	6792	Newbie from Canada	2006-01-12 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have been using ACV for the past few weeks to treat a nail fungus that has occupied a place under my toe nail for the lst 4 years. However I just noticed that (Earth Clinic's) recommendation is not to drink ACV straight?! I was drinking 2 Tablespoons in the morning, and tried 2 tablespoons in the morning and 2 at noon, and am now experiencing a pain in my side. I have not taken any ACV today at all and am hydrating myself to flush it out. Anyone ever experience this at all? On a positive note I see new nail coming up, as the yellow,white streaks under the nail are disappearing slowly. I am also using a combo of distilled vinegar water after a shower on infected area, then dab with tea tree oil, and then add vix. Working very well! Any advice on my side pains though? Its on my left side, maybe its my liver or something?? It just happened and I wonder if its because of taking such a concentrated amount of ACV. Please advise :)

All I did was drink ACV with bicarb soda each day (twice a day). In 3 months the nail with the fungus gradually grew out and I just kept cutting the bad nail off. I put nothing on the nail. It had been there for over 5 years and I had taken something in the past which did not work.

5828	95	6794	Gail from Florida	2006-06-16 00:00:00	BETTER BUT NOT CURED	2	0	I have had a nail fungus in my big toe for about 2 years. I didn't even know it was a fungus until someone told me of their nail fungus problem. Originally I thought I had damaged the nail by injury. My toe nail had a white streak in it, but wasn't all that noticeable. I usually never colored polish on my toes, but for two months, I was using dark colors. In between polishes, I noticed that half the nail was white! I freaked out and mentioned it to a few people who confirmed it was a fungus. I cant believe how the fungus took off so fast because of being covered by the polish! I had created a dark comfy breeding place without even realizing what I was doing. I began researching the web for natural remedies and I have been using the ACV, white vinegar and bleach for about 2 weeks now. The yellowing has disappeared. The affected area is very white. I clipped away most of the fungus, not too short though. Then, I filed the top of the nail so that the solutions that I use would penetrate more easily. The other day, I mentioned my problem to my cousin and she said that a friend of hers had a very bad nail fungus in 2 toes and began using (don't laugh) the generic brand for Monostat 7! She said that she applied it daily and at night she would get a Q-tip and apply under the nail as well as over the nail. She wore a sock to bed too. She did this for a few months until the nail grew out. It worked for her. With all my research, I have never heard of anyone mention this remedy? Any feedback or thoughts on this method? it kind of makes sense since it is a antifungal creme and is used internally. I just started using it tonight. I'm also going to try vicks. Maybe I will alternate between the vicks and the monostat and cleanse twice daily with the ACV and bleach solution. I'll keep you posted on my progress and appreciate any feedback about the Monostat cream. Thanks

I warmed it in the microwave to melt the honey and help it mix in and cover the taste of ACV. For the first time in nearly a week I can breathe freely through both nostrils. Amazing. I know vinegar - white and brown is useful for a thousand and one things around the home and for other health purposes so I tried this with a positive attitude and maybe it helped that I decided to believe it would work. Highly recommend.

Nothing was breaking it up: not neti pot, saline sprays, decongestant sprays (that makes it worse, eventually). In Oregon you must have a prescription for Sudafed, which has been the only remedy which works... "Phenylphrine" just doesn't do any good. So I tried the Apple Cider Vinegar potion with honey and hot water. I didn't think it would work, but less than 10 minutes I could breathe again!! Fantastic cure... I hope it lasts. Thank you!

I tried the ACV last night out of desperation. This horrendous tasting remedy did nothing for my sinuses but irritated my stomach and caused intestinal problems. The thought of drinking this potion again makes my skin crawl.

Have severe sinus congestion, at times during the day I can't blow in or out of my nose. I don't have infection, as I've just finished antibiotics. Nose has been plugged off and on for a month, increasingly more and more. Tried everything that has been recommended by friends/pharmacists etc to no avail. Was so happy to find this site and hear all the positive outcomes.... So mixed up the ACV, honey in water, drank it, nothing after 15 minutes, so drank some more with much less water. Even inhaled ACV fumes awhile. It's been 20 minutes and still no difference. I need this to work, but I have serious doubts.

I tried the acv recipe and I can feel my sinuses draining thank god. tomorrow is my 21st birthday so I have a big day ahead of me tomorrow. I tried (every otc medicine I could get my hands on). With no results they seemed to be congesting me even more and I couldn't sleep more then 2 hrs at a time. So I jumped on the web and looked up natural remedies and came across this website. I didn't have all or any of the ingredients to make the spicy tomato drink. So I went to the next remedy I could find on the site. Its now 4:20 am and I can breath now!! I live alone so i don't have measuring spoons/cups so I just put 2 big splashes of acv into a 1/2 bottle of water. I couldn't taste a thing so i drank it down and now I feel great (well I can breath/sleep now) I cant tell you how thankful I am. thanks again. who would have guessed acv is all i needed to breath lol. from skeptic to believer

I mixed 2 1/1 tablespoons of ACV into one 8oz glass of water then warmed it in the microwave drank it and BAHM my nose opened up, chest felt better and I no longer feel dizzy, weak. Before the ACV, I was on 3 antibiotics, mucus relief pill, sudafed for sinus congestion and cough. All the medication only made me feel worse...weak, dizzy but the ACV is awesome! I highly recommend it. I am even doing ACV inhalations. I have only been on it one day but so far results have been very promising.

I just tried two swigs of ACV and wow! The relief is instant. Much like eating spicy foods. I suspect the amount of relief one gets is directly related to how diluted (or not diluted) the ACV really is.
5848	96	6814	Ranjana from Arlington, Tx Usa	2009-09-03 00:00:00	QUESTION	7	0	If one has severe sinus congestion and starting to run a low grade fever is it too late to rely on ACV? Is it time for antibiotics or can ACV still cure it? Thanks

They put me on steriods and antibiotics. I've never quite felt the same since. Then I developed allergy sypmtoms since then too. I've been battling the green, nasty, thick snot for about a week now. I lost my job and no longer have insurance so I hopped online and found this. Well, the ACV that I use to condition my hair also got rid of this congestion. I have a huge bottle of it so I made the mixture. It has been a 1/2 hour and I'm not kidding, it's a MIRACLE!!! It's almost too good to be true. Oddly enough, I love the taste of vinegar...I know I'm weird, so this is like an excuse to drink vinegar. :)
5850	96	6816	Sara from Charlotte, NC	2009-06-12 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	ACV has helped my congestion; I have had sinus problems(congestion) for a few months and have tried prescription and OTC medicines. The over the counter stuff helped a little but not much and the prescription decongestant my doctor didn't want to prescribe it for me again after taking it for two months. I tried the ACV tonite and although it tasted bad I can breath out of my nose. I still have a headache and feel a little dizzy because I am still sick---but I can breath out of my nose. I drank this mixture: 2 tablespoons acv, 2 tablespoons honey and 8 ounces of warm water. I drank a tiny bit of soda afterwards to get the taste out of my mouth. I will try this again tommorow. It has been approx. 30 minutes since I drank the mixture and so far I am impressed with being able to breath thru my nose.
5851	96	6817	Lady T from Tallahassee, FL	2009-05-27 00:00:00	BETTER BUT NOT CURED	2	0	Awakened with nasal/sinus congestion on right side and irrigated with spray. It is now the end of the day, and the congestion has spread to the right ear with throbbing and pressure. I have a job interview tomorrow and HAVE to be alert and healthy. Decided to "google" sinus congestion remedies and found this amazing site. I found an unopened bottle of ACV, and I mixed about 2.25 TBS with a tall glass of room temperature water. Within the first couple of swallows, my sinuses began to drain, and my ear pressure was reduced. The taste is horrible, but I am encouraged already by the results. Will update my post in the A.M.
5852	96	6818	Belinda from Reynoldsburg, OH	2009-04-10 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	This is truly amazing! I haven't been able to breathe through my nose in three days, the congestion has been so bad. I couldn't even sleep last night because of it! I've tried five kinds of over the counter cold and sinus medicines and nothing phased it. I just drank a glass of water with 2.5 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar, and now I'm able to breathe freely. The effect was immediate. Thank you so much!! This site has been very helpful to me.
5853	96	6819	Terra  from Wayne, Michigan	2009-01-17 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Thank goodness for this site! I've had this horrible cold for 5 days now, I don't like over the counter cold remedies and I have no health insurance so I can't go to a doctor. About 5 minutes ago I mixed 2 Tablespoons of ACV with 8 ounces of water and BEHOLD!!! I can breathe again!! My sinuses are not all the way clear yet but the pressure is gone and one nostril is completely unblocked. I feel a lot better. Thanks eveyone for the great idea.
5854	96	6820	Stacey from Aurora, Ohio	2009-01-04 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have been struggling with re-accuring head colds/sinus issues since late Fall and don't you know, it hit me again. I have been using a nasal spray, which did help however it can only be used for three days. Last night was the last dose and of course, I woke up this morning all stuffed up and my ears are blocked, so I hopped online to see what I could find. I mixed 2 tablespoons of ACV and filled the rest of the glass (regular, tall) with water and drank it down. That was an hour and a half ago and I am already feeling much better. The congestion in my head is breaking up and my ears have already "popped" once and are less blocked than they have been. I am SO thankful that I found this site and all of the recommendations/testimonies for this home remedy.
5870	96	6835	Jitendra from Matsuyama, Ehime, Japan	2007-04-18 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have been suffering with sinositis for more than 6 years. so I always feel like having cold, block nose heaviness in head, strain on face etc etc. I even forgot how to live without these problems. I sometimes had severe headache in middle of my forehead and the area between nose and eyes. I was not aware that it was due to sinus pressure. Recently I had this pain and my nose was continuously blocked for 1 week. I couldnt blow my nose because moucous was very sticky and thick. I searched on internet and found this site, next day I bought ACV and started taking it. The next day the muocous got diluted, I could blow my nose. and within 2 hours I blowed my nose several time. I felt so relaxed. Now no nose block, no strain on face no headache. I am taking it for last 6 days. I dont know how long should I take it. But I will take it as ACV have other advantages too.
5855	96	6821	Greg from Walla Walla, Wa	2008-12-05 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Hello, after suffering the last few months with constant congestion both in my sinus's and my upper chest I checked myself into a hospital. After being poked and monitored for 3 days they discharged me after filling me with the same off the shelf Mucinex you can buy yourself. Of course after a day I started feeling bad again as the drug wore off. Out of desperation I turned to the Internet as I felt I was suffocating from the congestion. I found this website with all the testimonials on the wonders of using ACV. I went to the local market during lunch and bought a bottle of Heinz Apple Cider Vinegar...for $3 I'd take a chance...why not? That evening (four days ago) I started taking a tablespoon of ACV in a coffee mug I filled with water. In an hour my sinus's started feeling clearer. I had forgotten I could breath through my left nostril. I started drinking my "tea" in the morning and evening. Well, now its been 4 days and my chest is starting to clear also. Just yesterday I was still having the chest constrictions but today I feel great. I'm anxious to try the natural unfiltered ACV when and where I can find it. Also interested in adding local hometown honey if I can find it as I have read about the benefits here also. Now, I need to say that I'm an old crouch, 57 years old, and set in my ways. But I have to admit to you all that this has helped me. No voodoo magic stuff for me. Try it. I did and I'm happy. And the wife is happy too! She says I haven't snored in the three nights I've tried this. Of course I didn't think I ever snored!!
5856	96	6822	John R. from Chicago, IL	2008-11-30 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I've been having rough sinuses all year, mainly headaches but have had difficulty breathing through both nostrils. Been doing ACV 2 tbsps + some hot sauce + soy sauce (this part for flavor) + hot water. First two days had major relief and drainage. Have been two days on, one day off since then, and the relief is noticeable. Plus I have not been taking over the counter pain remedies at all and I was talking a lot even just the day before. I will say it tastes bad, and I will try prune juice once I get some. I will also say it's better than neti-pot, neti-pot never did much for me.
5857	96	6823	Trevor from Orem, UT	2008-11-14 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I used nose sprays or decongestant at night with a breathe right strip on my nose just so I could breathe at night while I slept. I have been doing that nightly for a couple years now. I finally got tired of being congested, even after using nasal sprays. When I came upon your site here, I figured I would try the ACV and see how it goes. I bought the cheapest and smallest bottle of ACV at my local grocery store and started immediately taking 2 TBSP ACV with about 8-12 ounces water then followed it up with milk or something to cover up the taste. Then I started combining ACV w/about 8 oz prune juice (it's not so bad!) which made it even easier to drink and didn't leave such a bad after-taste. I started to see a difference within a couple days. I could breathe a lot easier at night and daytime. It's now been 1 week without ever using my allergy medicine, decongestants and nose sprays. With just using the ACV, I feel great! What can I say? Apple Cider Vinegar cleared me up!
5858	96	6824	Nancy from St. Cloud, Florida	2008-09-27 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	2 TBSP Apple Cider Vinegar 2 TBSP Honey (local is always the best for you) 4 oz. water Mix, drink hot or cold. One day will cure you, however drink day two for assured cure. Tastes like a bad cup of tea...but will wipe out congestion. So simple, you won't want to try it..but why suffer, when its so easy to cure this life threatening ailment. Have used this when couldn't afford designer antibiotics..always works.
5859	96	6825	Sheila from Sterling Heights, MI	2008-09-19 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Well all I can say is that so far ( knock on wood!) it is a true miracle that something as simple as apple cider vinegar can clear your poor clogged & throbbing head! I have been sick now for 3 days & it came on like gangbusters! from the get go I had SEVERE throbbing pain in ALL my sinus cavities, congestion worse than anything! I too had to take 800mgs of Motrin to get any relief ( & it was not much) every 6 hours! YIKES! Hot water bottles, steamy showers, decongestants etc..... I found this page early this am & went directly to the store for some ACV, I drank it with warm purified water as well as a good steam mixed 1/2 &1/2 WITH WATER boiled.....towel over my head 10 mins..... it did take about 2-3 hours but WOW my headache is all but gone !!!! My nose & sinuses are draining, in a few hours I'm going to repeat! It's really worth a try, cheap easy & it worked!

The citric acid and acidity from the vinegar cut right through the mucous and the heat and caffeine from the tea help dilate your sinuses and blood vessels. Overall it makes you feel pretty good. I wouldn't say it helps cure anything - but definitely provides relief.
5861	96	6827	Jaimi from Orlando, FL	2008-06-06 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	WOW! I have come to love the wonderful product of ACV. I have had severe allergies and sinus problems since I could walk. Chronic bronchitis, sinusitis, tonsilitis (they have lonce since been removed), rhinitis, etc... I have always taken prescription medication. However I am 8 mos pregnant and have not been able to take anything but over the counter Tylenol products. For the past 3 days I have been down and out with a severe sinus migraine, congestion and pressure. Nothing worked and I am sleep deprived! Adding these symptoms to 8mos of pregnancy spells MISERY for sure. I was desperate so I hopped online and what do you know? I found the same product that cured my husband of his pesky wart will also clear my sinuses. I only wished I found this info sooner! I took 1 tbsp of ACV with 8oz of water and downed. Then I made a mixture and put it in my veggie steamer (ACV is also a great residue cleaner) and sat over it for about 5mins. Everything started to clear up within the hour. I then rinsed with saline solution and I can breathe out of both nostrils! My headache is almost gone and the pressure almost nil! Oh and by the way the ACV steam bath is great for oily skin. I noticed a difference immediately after the face bath. I was then curious to see if this was a known rememdy for acne/skin problems and sure enough it is!!! In fact, Earth Clinic was the first hit. I am amazed that such a simple, inexpensive product can do so much. Thank you dearly for this site.

I had planned to visit the doctor, but found this website first. I have ACV at home, so that nite, a couple days ago, I drank a glass of water with at least one oz. of ACV in it. In 1 hour, my headache was gone and I could breath again, and slept great! I sniffed the ACV the next day and drank more of it, I don't think it taste bad, actually. I am completely cured of a painful sinus infection!!

5863	96	6828	Pam from Flower Mound, TX	2008-03-12 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I must admit- I had little faith but was desperate. After three rounds of antibiotics and still constant congestion/ sinus infection, I became addicted to Afrin. Using it twice daily cleared my nose enough for me to make calls at work and sleep at night but after only two weeks, I had to increase to 4x's a day to stay clear. I realized this was a major problem and began searching for alternative solutions. After reading the earthclinic site, I threw out the Afrin, purchased apple cider vinegar and a Neti Pot (since lots of friend have been recommending it too). My nose was so clogged the Neti Pot was not effective- the water had no where to do. So, I mixed the one TBS. of ACV with 8 oz. of water and chugged it. I haven't been able to taste anything for over a week but could still feel the bitter tingle on my tounge. I was disappointed when I didn't feel relief within the hour. The evening passed and I realized as I went to lay down for the night- I could breathe through my nose. While it wasn't totally clear- I could sleep with my mouth closed- without using the dreaded Afrin! I followed the same procedure the next day and by the second night- I was breathing totally clear and feeling great! GOD BLESS YOU earth clinic. My taste buds are back and the ACV is terrible but I don't care- it's worth it x's 100 for the relief I finally feel!!! After reading the other benifits ACV offers- I have recommended it and your site to many family and friends. Thanks again!
5864	96	6829	Pauline from Yuma, AZ	2008-02-18 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	After being overseas for awhile, I returned back to Yuma, AZ and seen a doctor about my sinus. Well, he made his diagnosis from my charts dated one year ago. I didn't take any free drugs that he had given to me and surfed the internet for cures. I tried the vinegar and it really helped my clogged sinus. The cayenne pepper in water also took out the soreness in my throat. The slice of apple really helped the acid reflux (loose water pipe that I hear at nights.) Many thanks. I hope that you will continue because there are MANY medical care people nowadays only looking to obtain more money instead of really caring for their patients. Very superficial care.

I suffer from chronic allergies/sinus infections. It has only been 24 hrs and I CAN BREATHE!! I had problems breathing out of my left nostril and my left side of my face always has sinus pain...it has completely opened up. I cannot wait to see other health benefits including some weight loss. It has suppressed my appetite today!

I drank the stuff and steamed it in water and inhaled it. All that I accomplished was drying out my skin on my face incredibly so I look about 20 years older with wrinkles and my sinuses are getting worse. I would not recommend apple cider vinegar to anyone! It is a drying acid!
5867	96	6832	Rebecca from Somerset, Ohio	2007-09-30 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have had horrible sinus problems for almost a year. My doctor deeps prescribing different allergy medicines. No matter which one, the side effects were much worse than having a constantly clogged nose. Don't we all need to be alert? I have been hearing about ACV from some of my "natural" friends and family and thought nothing of it until I found this website. I started doing "shots" of ACV 2 days ago and already noticed a big difference! If you mix that with water - there's just more of it to drink - plus when you're really really clogged you can't taste much of it anyway. The natural tastes better!

After reading several testamonials i went straight to the kitchen and got poured a 1/3 cup ACV to 1/3 cup water (i don't like ACV) but was willing to try anything! chased it down with a little pomegranite juice and 15 min later i could breathe again.

It helped some of my problems but I still get the sinus infections at least three times a year. I have been on antibiotics for almost three weeks now. I felt somewhat better. Then the pain came back. I googled home remedies and found this site. I tried the Apple Cider Vinegar and honey. It has already helped. It's been twenty min. and a lot of the pressure in my face has stopped. I will try again in the morning. Thank you!

5872	96	6837	Terri from Duluth, GA	2007-01-31 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	The apple cider vinegar is a miracle cure for sinuses. I came down with a nasty respiratory virus the week before Christmas, 2006 that got into my sinuses, which were already irritated by allergies. After two rounds of antibiotics, loads of over the counter drugs and several weeks of terrible headaches and congested sinuses, I found this site in desperation. I had been suffering for four days from an awful headache that would only go away with 800 mg. Advil. I hate taking anything, but the thought of taking that everyday was really getting to me. I took my first shot of ACV around 4 p.m. My head opened up immediately and by 6 p.m., my headache and all the congestion was completely gone. By the next day, I felt great...better than I had in weeks and I slept better than I had in a long time. I had a small amount of congestion the following day that cleared immediately when I took the ACV. Since then, I've been taking 2 tbsp. with a little baking soda in about 8 oz. of spring water 3x per day. I'm planning to keep going too. I'm hoping to see some of the other benefits people talk about here, but this stuff is nothing short of amazing when it comes to sinus problems. Thank the Lord for this relief. I've been spreading the good news to everyone!

So I'm online again looking for something that works

I CAME ONLINE TO TRY TO FIND A HOME REMEDY THAT I CAN USE AND I READ ABOUT THE WONDERS OF APPLE CIDER VINEGAR SO I LITERALLY RAN ACROSS THE STREET AND BOUGHT MYSELF A BOTTLE OF HEINZ APPLE CIDER VINEGAR AND TRIED A COUPLE OF TBL SPOONS OF THE VINEGAR W/WATER AND IT CLEARED IT RIGHT AWAY. I'M GLAD I FOUND THIS BECAUSE I'M 1 MONTH PREGNANT AND I DIDN'T WANNA TAKE ANY MEDICATIONS. I HAVE A QUESTION THOUGH, I'M NOT A DOCTOR SO I DON'T ACTUALY KNOW IF THIS WOUD BE BAD FOR MY BABY. WOULD IT?

My doctor refused to reccomend anything, she claimed that it would eventually clear up, I begged her for something and when she finally did and I read the ingredients and side effects and I decided not to take it. Finally I remembered the old ACV and took it with one clove of garlic in warm water. My sinuses cleared. I continued to take it throughout my pregnancy every night and never experienced another cold or sinus infection the whole duration. What is more I was high risk, plus overweight and never experienced complications. ACV is surely for the healing of nations.

It clears up many infectious disorders in the internal system, digestive tract disorders, not to mention the least. It should come as no surprise to all who write these great letters of response that we are our own worst enemies and fund millions to the health care systems when in fact we can learn to take care of ourselves with a little common sense and healthy diet.

I did an internet search hoping to find something to help, I came upon your website and although I was skeptical I tried mixing 1/4 C ACV with 16 oz of water and downed it all at once. That was only 20 minutes ago and I can feel a difference all ready, my sinuses are draining and my ears are starting to clear. I wish I would have known about this sooner! Thanks again!

I've had one on my head, face and neck for five days! I am so thankful for this website and I encourage anyone with a sinus problem to give this a try. Just drinking the acv mixture didn't do the trick for me--but using the acv steam and nasal treatment with the acv drink surely has proven to be the answer for me. thanks!

For those who can't handle the taste try steam inhaling to clear the congestion. For a simple and quick session, I filled a small pan with half water and half acv and boil on the stove. Once it comes to a full boil turn off the stove and just breathe in the steam. My husband thought I just worked a miracle on him with this simple procedure. Good luck!!
5882	96	6847	Tuffy Sourdough from Newell, S.D.	2009-03-18 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	sinus congestion relief: Mix 2 or 3 teaspoons of brown sugar, 2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar. Tastes great and relieves congestion. Even better: add 1/4 cup raisins and boil, then allow to cool.
5952	97	6916	Christina from Kansas City, Mo	2010-02-17 00:00:00	SIDE EFFECTS	5	0	I have tried drinking 1 T. ACV in a cup of hot water, and it only results in heartburn. I want to give this a chance, as so many people attest to the benefits of ACV. Any tips? I have had 2 dental extractions, both teeth were infected, there was communication from the teeth into the sinus, and now I have a sinus infection. It's been a mess. I am on 2 abx now, but so far, nothing has worked. I'm desperate for solutions since I've been sick since Thanksgiving.

Tried acupuncture and that helped a lot, but when on a course of Phellostatin and that was my first real relief...along with one capsule of Cayenne pepper which took away the post nasal drip...this should not be taken too often as it moves the blood and really clears the system. Chronic sinusitis with digestive problems...it was felt by myself and my acupuncturist that fungus was my problem even though I had take Diflucan almost 2x a month. Acupuncture really helps me along with the Phellostatin and the Cayenne Pepper. Acupuncture assists the body to do the clearing and healing needed. Acupuncture was my final and last straw to try as I had tried most conventional medicine doctors and their treatments. Nasal sprays and prednisone. I do stay away from dairy products, but am now noticing that even if I have some I do not react with inflammation as I did before! I can eat cheese and not sneeze or get stuffy anymore. Wish I had gone this route from the beginning.

I have eaten ice cream ( all kinds ) since I was a kid ( I'm 43 ). I never had sinus problems...until, 7 years ago, when I met my husband, and started sleeping in an air-conditioned room. He practically "lives" on chocolate milk, and loves his air conditioner. He constantly has sinus trouble. I believe the air conditioner is the culprit.

I had a touch of bronchitis in Nov. My first ever Sinus infection happened in February, following bronchitis. My doc gave me a great antibiotic - and everything was fine until March when the Washington DC area pollen begins in full force. New pollen for me, so I was mildly sick with my allergies.
5886	97	6851	Mamta from Indiana	2006-10-27 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	i haven't taken any off the counter medicines for colds since 5 yrs !! and my condition was pretty bad when i came to the US. we got Ajwain seeds from an indian store or you will find it in the indian section of a chinese food store . Ajwain is indian oregano but very strong. every time i get a cold and chest is congested...i take one tsp of ajwain and roast it on a flat pan. once it starts to smoke , quickly put in a kitchen tissue and take deep inhalations, it makes you sneeze since all the nerve in the nose are raw from the cold....but in 5 minutes it all peaceful, no more colds. and RELIEF...esp. helpful in asthmatic attacks.....also have a strong concoction of ginger,black pepper, clove, basil and cinnamon...boil it in water for 5-10 min and after it cools a bit put a tsp of honey and have it hot. honey should not be heated. according to Ayurveda all these thing reduce phlegm in the body.... enjoy

Within 10 minutes of sipping the solution I bent down to pick something up from the floor and whooosh the whole lot cleared from my sinus. I've drunk the rest over the balance of the evening and have not had pain or drips since. It makes your throat a bit raspy but hey... What a simple yet effective fix. Much appreciated folks!!!
5888	97	6853	Susie from Salem, Or	2013-01-29 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	My husband has had chronic sinus infections, with allergy's. I found your article on the Internet and talked him into trying it, he suffered for years with ringing ears, dizziness , and no sense of smell, they all seem to go along with his sinus congestion and pain. As soon as he started the Apple Cider Vinegar , his ringing ears stopped, as did the dizziness, and he even smells certain odors. The pain also left. I thought he was just getting old with most of those symptoms, but they are gone and he feels great. We are both taking the vinegar everyday and will probably keep on, I have allergies and have problems breathing through my nose and get ear aches, those symptoms have gone away for me also.

5891	97	6856	Vivi from Nottingham, United Kingdom	2012-12-07 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Thankfully I found this website. I had a nasty cold and chesty cough, which turned into a vicious and lingering sinus infection, which would not budge even with numerous saline rinses and steaming, so by the 5th week I was driven to go the doctors, who prescribed antibiotics. I have also lost my sense of smell and taste for the last 2 weeks. I have ME/CFS and am very sensitive to medication especially antibiotics & steroids, so didn't really want to try them, but felt desperate. Needless to say I got terrrible side effects after only 2 tablets, so had to discontinue them.
5892	97	6857	Texaschic from Lantana, Tx	2012-10-11 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	This really works folks! I had a sore throat for 2 days and on day 3 in went into my sinus (where I have a deviated septum). The pain was excruciating! (even on 600 mg of Ibuprofen) I was volunteering at the school and I had to leave due to the pain. Couldn't get any air through my left side and extreme pain throughout the entire lower and upper sinuses. Miserable~!
5893	97	6858	Don from Moorpark, Ca	2012-10-09 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have had sinus problems for at least 10 years. I have used all the allergy medicines in combination with antibiotics, but hated the side effects. After getting this last infection I checked the internet for a cure and the ACV article came up, I thought I would try and after about an hour felt relief in my sinus. Nice simple cure. Thanks for the information.
5894	97	6859	Stallischelle from West Allis, Wi	2012-09-07 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I've been suffering with a sinus infection for 8 months, and have tried seemingly everything offered by Eastern and Western health practices: Chinese herbs formulated for sinus health, acupuncture, chiropractic adjustments, two rounds of antibiotics, and a prescription nasal spray combined with a daily dose of allergy meds. Now armed with a bottle of organic ACV with the 'mother', I am finally winning the battle! Three times a day I drink a tea consisting of 8oz. Water, 1 Tablespoon ACV and 1 Tablespoon of locally harvested honey. Once daily I use a NetiPot with 8oz. Distilled water, 1/4 tsp. ACV and 1/4 tsp. Plain salt (4oz. Per nostril). I've tried the NetiPot before without much success, but once I added the ACV I noticed an immediate improvement. Yes, it burns some but the results are more than worth the short term discomfort. My sinuses have cleared significantly after only two days, and I intend to continue with this routine to kick out the infection altogether. I am also considering adding the practice of oil-pulling to even further reduce the bacteria and toxins that my body is apparently harboring.
5953	97	6917	3rdcamaro from Littleton, Co	2010-02-07 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Just tried ACV for my ongoing sinus problems (infection, congestion, etc) that have plagued me for over six weeks. I am a skeptic, but within 30 minutes I was breathing better - for real! This stuff is great. I used the 2 TBSP in 8 ounces of warm water. Amazing!
5895	97	6860	Adambur from Kansas City, Missouri	2012-08-24 00:00:00	BETTER BUT NOT CURED	2	0	Similar to others I hate antibiotics and the negative side effects associated with them. Came to this site for a sinus infection that I suffered with for over a week. Tried saline sinus rinse which would clear me up enough to sleep through the night along with breathe right strips. After continuing to be miserable I tried 8oz warm distilled water, 2tbsp organic unfiltered apple vinegar with mother, and 1 tbsp honey. Maybe I am a baby but this tasted awful. I had major troubles drinking it without gagging. I hated it. Being desperate, I forced it down. A few minutes later I noticed pressure relief in my forehead but nostrils weren't as clear as I had hoped. I could definitely tell a difference in my facial pressure so will use this again (with more honey and maybe a green tea bag) along with the sinus sinse. Made me a believer.
5896	97	6861	Skeptic To Believer  from Chicago, Il	2012-08-16 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I had to add my success with ACV for sinus infections. I recently got hit quickly with a sinus infection after having travelled on a long flight. I've been a sufferer for several years now and have always gone to the doctor for a script. Never again! This worked so well! The infection hit me Tues morning and I knew I wouldn't be able to get in to see my doc - plus, I was so tired of being bound to going to the doc and to prescriptions every time this happened. I found this site and got the recipe for a couple of TBSP ACV (organic, raw, unfiltered with the "mother" - that's the key), warm water and honey. I eyeballed the amounts and took the first cup on Tues night. I couldn't believe that I slept through the night - that never happens with the onset of a sinus infection. I continued to drink 3-4 cups throughout the day on Wed. By Wed night, I was feeling fine. Fine!! I will continue to drink it today because I'm not quite 100% yet, but I am stunned by the effectiveness of this natural remedy! Very happy to report a very enthusiastic "yea". Thank you, thank you, thank you!
5897	97	6862	Shawn from Ny	2012-08-02 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have been suffering from mulitple sinus infections for the past year now. I took antibiotics over and over just as soon as it would work a week or two later it was back. I came upon this site and decided to give Apple Cider Vinegar a try thinking it was better than a run to the emergency room. I took the 2 tablespoons of Apple Cider Vinegar with 8oz of water and abracadabra just as simple as that it was gone.......... Definitely, definitely, definitely works. Im so thankful for this site.
5898	97	6863	Rachel from Plainfield, Illinois	2012-07-01 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I had a wicked sinus infection. The pressure was all through my face, head, and ears. It felt like my head was going to explode! I went to the doctor but they wouldn't see me because I couldn't find my insurance card (blessing in disguise). I came home (totally upset and crying which doesn't help! ) and Googled how to get rid of a sinus infection without antibiotics and I found this wonderful website. I get an infection about 1-2 times a year and off to the doctors for antibiotics I go. Well NEVER AGAIN!

Just drank the ACV, water and honey...... And I feel better already. I will try more later.... It is 10pm.... Thank you for the suggestion. I NEVER get sick... And did not want to go to the doctor or take prescribed meds. Thank you Thank you
5900	97	6865	Sophie from Seattle	2012-05-18 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I had my first sinus infection which is caused by bacteria My symptoms: a stiff neck, headache and fever I had no idea that a stiff neck is considered a serious sinus infection yet I was not stuffed up at all. I had a facial rash during and after the sinus infection I don't understand how you get a rash from the sinus infection? Anyhow took ACV and zinc that helped tremendously.
5901	97	6866	George from Toronto, Ontario, Can	2012-04-27 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Got a cold from my grandchild and it developed into yet another sinus infection. Woke up 4 mornings in a row with a pressure headache and yellow discharge. It was so bad I had to leave work early yesterday. I looked up natural remedies (hate taking antibiotics) and found some people swear by apple cider vinegar. This site helped the most. Wow! I have never seen anything work this well. Simply amazing.
5902	97	6867	Norm from Menifee, Ca, Usa	2012-04-19 00:00:00	NAY	1	0	I tried the apple cider vinegar mixture and it helped some the first time, but after that no benefit. My doctor had me on Mucinex, 4 pills a day for ten days and Motrin for pain. I'm still not out of it, but it's better.
5903	97	6868	Holly from Buffalo, Ny	2012-04-12 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have to say that like many others here, I was skeptical at best. I didn't think that the ACV in my fridge that I use for cooking could do anything for my sinus pressure. But, when I woke up this morning with severe head pain, jaw pain and no way to breathe, I was willing to try anything (except calling the doctor for antibiotics that would likely result in a yeast infection, another round of medication for that, and a following week of stomach upset and mood swings). At 4:30, I used my neti pot and got some serious results, but still felt the jaw pain and head pressure. So, at 6:30, I mixed 8oz of water, 2TBSP ACV, 2tsp purified honey (leftover in the cupboard from when the tike was an infant). I sipped it like a tea, and felt the effects about 20 minutes later. I started alternate nostril breathing, in on the good side, out on the clogged side, and it really got things going. Then I tried the ACV treatment again an hour later, and I can breathe clearly. My jaw pain is gone, with just a little stiffness left. My sinuses are clear and I feel amazing. I also did an oil pull in between the two ACV treatments, but don't think I swished long enough because the oil wasn't white when I spit. thank you to everyone who posted their amazing results.
5904	97	6869	Sbkymberli  from Santa Barbara, Ca, United States	2012-04-10 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I must say I was fairly skeptical when I read about the Apple Cider Vinegar cure for an acute sinus infection. In all of my 48 years I had never once heard anyone mention this, but after feeling absolutely miserable for 3 straight days I was willing to try anything.
5905	97	6870	Lopez1775 from Orlando, Fl	2012-04-03 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Thanks EC.. I read the post about 2 tbs of ACV 8 oz of water and some honey for my sinus infection. In minutes I felt the relieve of the sinus pressure in my head and ears. Thanks to all for the post. It saved me a trip to the doctor plus very expensive antibiotics.

5907	97	6872	Gail from Ft. Myers, Florida	2012-03-16 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have about had it with this sinus infection/allergy problem for the past 2 weeks. The pollen count is so high in Florida right now, and I have never felt so miserable. I love when it rained, for only then did my symptoms subside. Unfortunately, it only rained twice in 2 weeks. Eyes are watering, throat itching, face hurts and swollen, continual nose blowing and ears hurt. It reached its high point today. I am allergic to antihystamines so my options are limited. I could go to an ENT doctor, but I already know he would prescribe a strong antibiotic, which my body does not handle well.
5910	97	6875	Mashley  from Jackson, Mississippi, Usa	2011-12-18 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Apple Cider Vinegar for sinus infections works like a charm. I was a complete non-believer but found myself a bit desprate as I am flying in 2 days and had a pretty good sinus infection going. Major symptoms included: running nose, clogged ears and tremendous pressure in my face. I filled a mug half way full of water and microwaved until hot. I then filled the rest of the cup with several tablespoons of Organic ACV. I added a bag of ginger/lemon tea, local honey and a strong pinch of ground ginger. After the first mug, the pressure in my face began to reduce. About an hour later, I had another mug and the pressure continued to subside. The tonic increased my runny nose and reduced some of the ear pressure. It was by no means a great but was improved. The next morning, I was shocked at how much better I felt. Again, I made the tonic 3 times that day seeing some improvement after each glass. The next day (today) I am feeling about 85% better. Only symptoms being tiredness and slight pressure in one ear. Overall, this is a wonderful way to get rid of a sinus infection quickly. I will add that I am taking a Z Pack but historically, they take 5 or 6 days to work (if it works at all... ). I feel very confident that the ACV is what pushed me back to health so quickly.
5911	97	6876	Amy from Kitchener, Ontario, Canada	2011-12-05 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I am suffering from my second sinus infection. the first one I had was last year around this time (December) and got so bad that my face turned red and swollen and I had terrible head aches. I went on antibiotics and a saline spray the doctor recommended, and within a few weeks, it was gone, but the antibiotics killed all beneficial bacteria in my body as well, and a yeast infection followed. I woke up today with the beginnings of what feels like a second sinus infection.
5912	97	6877	Lori from Westport, Ct	2011-12-04 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I am a firm believer in the healing properties of Apple Cider Vinegar. I came down w/ a horrible sinus infection/laryngitis yesterday and today have been sipping on 2 Tb ACV and 16 oz water.... A miracle... What a relief! ~!!!!
5913	97	6878	Bob Bode from Frisco, Co	2011-11-25 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I routinely use dilute apple cider vinegar/water solution for ear infections which freguently occur after swimming in pools. I recently started using it very successfully for sinus infections that occur with or without a cold. I taste the solution first. If it is very strong vinegar taste it probable will sting, so I dilute it more. (Bacteria do not like the acid in vinegar)
5914	97	6879	Sean from Bastrop, Texas	2011-11-23 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I had been struggling with a very mild but disgusting sinus infection for 8 weeks. It came from a secondary infection after a viral cold. I'm lucky in that it barely bothered me (sticky yellow blob 2-3 times a day, breathe fine), but I couldn't get rid of it. I even took 10 days of antibiotics (thinking it would help) to no avail. I was skeptical (like always) when I saw this, but I went ahead and tried 1 teaspoon in some water. ONLY ONE TEASPOON ANNIHILATED MY INFECTION. It is the day after and I no longer have any discharge at all.

I put 2 tbsp. of ACV and a few tsps. of honey in some hot water..... Doesn't taste so good, but 5 minutes of drinking that is soooo worth getting rid of the pressure in my head... This was my second sinus infection ever, and I have a feeling I am prone to them now as my mom said she gets them often..... Didn't want to go get the usual antibiotics, they throw my whole system off for weeks after I take them.

I tried the neti pot and it worked great, just feels funny. So I surfed the net looking for something else. I came across this site and thought I'd give ACV a shot. Just made myself a cup before this post. I added the lemon and honey as suggested and it taste pretty good. I don't feel any effects yet but I'm only halfway through the cup. The neti pot cleared out my sinus cavity I just need to get the gook off the back of my throat........ Well my cup is done...... Still no effect.... Oh no wait... There it is, it's breaking it up a little. I will see what it does over the next couple of minutes... Thanks for your help.
5918	97	6883	Yayamom3 from Kansas City, Mo	2011-11-02 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Several years ago, I had probably my third or fourth sinus infection of the year on New Year's Eve. I researched homeopathic treatments online, and found the apple cider vinegar treatment. I did it, and it worked! After mentioning this to my doctor, she told me about apple cider vinegar tablets (drinking the stuff is disgusting! ). In addition to curing sinus infections, she said they would also prevent them and were just good for overall health. I have been taking one tablet a day ever since. I haven't had a sinus infection in five years!

I had a really bad sinus infection and after 2 weeks of it, went to the doctor. I got an injection of antihistimines and 10 days of antibiotics.

And I've probably had 13ish times. Well, when it gets close to fall, about now in Iowa(:, my dad always buys apple cider. I also just got off medication for a sinus infection about a week ago. Yesterday and last night I felt it coming on again my snot changes to almost a dark yellow brown color, and as soon as I blow my nose it immediately closes back up. So anyways I had a glass this morning with my breakfast and my nose got majorly better! ... So I had another glass and the results were better! So being a curious one, I googled sinus infection remedies and waaalaaw! Apple cider is one! I have like no claug at all! So anyone reading this pllleeeaaassseee give it a try! :) Haha what a wonderful day!!!

I started having terrible sinus pain yesterday, so much that the pain was waking me up throughout the night. I used my sinus rinse but to no avail. So I thought I may as well try the ACV. Holy moly! I heated a coffee cup full of water, added 2 TBSP of ACV and a bit of honey. Halfway through the cup (sipping... Not a bit fan of the taste of vinegar! ) I could literally FEEL the gunk in my sinuses loosening up. I cannot believe how fast this works. I read many of the testimonials on ACV/sinuses but thought it really could not work that quickly.... I admit, I was wrong! I am absolutely and undoubtedly a believer.... Off to finish the rest of my cup :) Shawna

I told my friends, that could hardly understand me as I sound so pathetic, I feel like one of those cartoon characters where they are runing around screaming and the head explodes! My eyes hurt so bad I just wanted to cry all night (pause, sip) On antibiotics and mucinix and saline and vicodine so far the best I got was an occasional feeling of maybe air, but mouth breathing is my only surviaval... Sip.... Ok OMG left side just opened! Although right is my worst side. My recipe is actually very yummy and I HATE ACV I put 2 tbs ACV 1 heaping tbs honey and a decent splash of lemon juice in a coffe cup and heated in m/w. sip again!! I am not kidding, this email has taken about 5 mins and I feel relief! Pain in right eye still severe, but definitely a big difference. Put it this way, I am in sales and I could not talk on phone as it was disgusting, I would pick up phone now. Try it. Lemon truly made a huge difference and it actually tastes good!!!

Still sick and need to be well! I did the steam with ACV and it did work well for me and cleared my head. Today, I'm trying the ACV to drink. I made an 8 oz mug of tea, mixed 2 TBSP of ACV and a little honey (apple tea) - it really seemed to clear my head about five minutes after I drank it. It didn't clear it completely, but I could feel my pressure being relieved just a little. I'm going to keep trying this method and see if maybe it will work... so far so good.

But I read everyone's tips here on apple cider vinegar and decided to try it (with scepticism). After sniffing the steam of hot half apple cider vinegar and water, the next morning I woke to no pain and only a slight clear discharge and have been better now for days. These home remedies here are worth their weight in gold and I'll be happy to hang around and hear even more :).

I used the standard apple cider vinegar (ACV)-water mixture to dose myself for relief. It helped me considerably, and cut the progress of the infection and flu short. I whole-heartedly believe that the ACV did the trick. My sinuses were clearing up and the mucus thinned so that my breathing was easy and not painful.
5927	97	6892	Robert from Escondido, California Us	2011-04-07 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have suffered from sinus problems for 25 years. Cannot even take any medication for relief. Had allergy shots for 1 1/2 years. No relief. I bought 5 allegra tablets and took 2. Could not stand the side affects. Out of desperation I asked the internet and found Apple Cider Vinegar as a possible cure. I went to the store and got Apple Cider Vinegar and honey. Went home and mixed it up. I no longer feel I am going to choke and die in the morning. I am 54 and it was just getting worse. My third day and I feel great. I can breath through my nose again and have a lot more energy and sleep good at night and wake up with clear unconjested sinus's.

5929	97	6894	P. from Redondo Beach, Ca	2011-02-18 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	My son (6 years old) has been using apple cider vinegar to treat his chronic sinus infection. I learned it from a web-site(couldn't remember which one) which recommended adult to take it the minute the sinus infection start w/2 tbsp apple cider vinegar w/a bit of honey 3x a day for at least 3 days or more. I think that's the key, the minute you felt you come down w/stuffy nose you should start the treatment right away, don't delay.
5930	97	6895	Barbara859 from Mission Viejo, Ca	2011-02-13 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Apple Cider Vinegar really helped. I have been suffering from a sinus infection for a few days. First I tried the 2 tablespoons ACV and 2 tablespoons water and heated it and inhaled the steam. It made my eyes water a little. I felt a bit of relief, then after about 1/2 an hour I tried 2 tablespoons of ACV in 8 ounces of warm water and drank it. I started to feel better in about 20 minutes. What a relief!
5931	97	6896	Valeriaj from Carefree, Az	2011-02-07 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I can't believe this! took one glass of 8 oz water with 2 tbls of ACV and my painful sinus went away in less than 12 hours! one glass! I was in such pain, couldn't bend my head down, pain when pressing on the sinus area, stuffed nose... All cleared! relief in 20 min or so after drinking straight up in the evening and full clearance of symptoms when I woke up next morning! wow! thank you earth clinic and contributors of feedback!
5932	97	6897	John Lees. from Sydney, Australia	2011-01-27 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have been having about three sinus infections each year for the past three years. I am 62 and found this very hard to take. Having just had another infection and another round of anti-biotics and anti histmine as per the doctors instruction. Two weeks later same again in desperation went online and asked for natural cures for sinus.

I only started this today but I am already feeling more clear headed and my headache is better. I am eager to see how I feel in 2 more days and a several more doses. Does anyone know if I can overdose on ACV?
5956	97	6920	Arlene from Meredosia, Il	2009-12-23 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	My husband and I have been miserable lately with sinus infections. I do not take any medication unless I have to, diabetes and blood pressure are all I take so I was looking for something natural. Found this site accidently, tried the apple cider vinegar. We found out the next day that we were using the distilled and that that was incorrect, but, we both woke up in the morning with our heads completely cleared. We will get the right kind of acv in a few days, but so far this is working. We both feel so much better, and can breathe clearly. I was very sceptical, but I'm so glad that I found this. Thank you so much for this site. I have shared this with my whole family.

When I use this after a yoga shoulderstand my headache/sinus pain goes away within an hour. To be fair, I like vinegar - a LOT - I could see where this might be challenging to someone who doesn't care for vinegar.

I usually have sinus issues twice each year. I take the apple cider vinegar capsules from the health food store. Also, when I have been exposed to strep throat, I gargle with ACV.

" I was diagnosed with a sinus infection and given the ________. On my way home from the pharmacy, I stopped to visit a friend. He made me the "miracle tea" which included ACV and honey. This morning I woke up without a sore throat. I was skeptical last night, but now I know it honestly works! ! Thank you for this website.

5940	97	6904	Sheila  from New York, Ny, Usa	2010-06-23 00:00:00	BETTER BUT NOT CURED	2	0	I am 46 and have suffered from sinus infections for 25 years. I do find using a neti pot with saline solution helps as a preventive measure and, if I have an infection, it temporarily relieves congestion. Avoiding dairy, with the exception of soured products is very helpful. Sudafed and steroidal sprays sometimes keep an infection at bay if I start using them soon enough. But over the last 2 years, the presenting symptoms have changed so I often don't realize I'm on the verge of getting an infection. Instead, I feeel fine and and then, seemingly out of nowhere, my teeth and jaws aches, the pressure begins, and so does the bad taste in my mouth. Very quickly, The pain becomes so unbearable that I wish someone would lop off my head. Then there's the nausea, from swallowing the nasty drip. And the lightheadness or dizziness. All in all, it's horrendous. Unlike a lot of posters, I did use antibiotics several times/year and had much success. But I worry more & more about the bacteria morphing and becoming resistant. And who wouldn't rather refrain from using prescription drugs if natural remedies work? All this to say that I mixed up 2 TBSP of organic, undiluted ACV in 10 oz. warm water & a good TSP of raw honey and drank it down thru a straw a little over an hour ago. The congestion & pressure has eased. My ears popped and no longer feel clogged at all. My teeth and jaw are not throbbing and my eyes somehow feel less swollen. I'm thrilled! It's bedtime now, so I'll be curious to see how I sleep and how I feel in the morning after a 2nd dose. Maybe I diluted the ACV more than most and I'm sure the honey helped too. But I didn't find the taste as horrifying or burning as a lot of other posters. At any rate, I'm really encouraged by how much better I feel & how quickly! A million thanks!
5941	97	6905	Jnd2008 from Central Ny, Ny	2010-05-22 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Male 41 very good shape. Well that was until Feb, when I picked up a cold. Sinus never really cleared. Orange juice, on the shelf meds, over the counter meds, ditched any @ all dairy, upped the vitamin intake as well as variety. Throat very slowly but surely got worse. It's now mid May and I'm on my knee's sneezing really thick deep green things that fill a scott towel and thinking of a doctors visit. Then I found this site. Read a bunch and came a crossed ACV mix's for flushing the sinus. A good friend told me about Apple Cider Vinegar once, and how it helps the body.
5942	97	6906	Beverly from Lake Elsinore, California	2010-05-03 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I was suffering a major sinus infection for 3 days. Feeling congestion , pressure in my head, stuffy nose, itchy throat, head ache, and productive cough. I was taking over the counter nasal spray, antihistamine, and pain relievers. I decided last night to try the a ACV with the mother remedy. 2 tbs in 8 oz of warm water. After the first few sips I felt the pressure in my head go away! I could not believe it. Took another glass this morning and afternoon. I feel much better. Except I cannot smell. I'm hoping my sense of smell returns soon. I am so glad I did not have to go to the doctor and have to take antibiotics! thank you Earth Clinic!
5955	97	6919	Strangelilmama  from Santa Fe, Nm, USA	2009-12-29 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I hesitate to speak too soon, but after 10 days with a relentless cold, I woke up with a raging sinus infection yesterday; fever, swelling of my face, redness over my cheekbones, couldn't breathe through my nose whatsoever. I stayed home from work & was ready to call my doctor, knowing she would prescribe antibiotics, which I try to avoid as often as possible. I dreaded the aftermath of the antibiotics, but I also knew this was a doozy of an infection. My husband had read up on ACV a while back, and we had some in the house, so when I googled natural sinus infection remedies & saw all the testimonies here, I thought I'd give it a shot. I took two tablespoons in warm water (a big mug, probably 10-12 oz), plus a tbsp of honey three times yesterday. I also used a saline rinse/ neti pot. I am like NIGHT & DAY today. I am not 100% yet, but I can breathe, the swelling went down, the redness is gone, and I feel functional. I do still have some congestion & my face is a bit tender, but it is no longer terribly painful. Perhaps TMI, but the nasty green-yellow mucus has gotten considerably less disgusting-looking, too.

Before I tried this method, swallowing saliva was painful, but after the pain is much more bearable. This is also a convenient way because I found this site at school, and didn't have the leisure to get warm tea.
5943	97	6907	Michael from Fort Lauderdale, Florida	2010-04-29 00:00:00	BETTER BUT NOT CURED	2	0	Good morning. I hope you can help me with this. I have had very bad sinuses for many many years and has been very debilitating. It is primarily on the right side of my head and i believe that the upper right frontal/temple are the culprits here. I have used your vinegar for about 3 days nows using variation.s. One day I did 8 ozes of water with 2 tablespoons vinegar 3 times a day then the next day I took an 8 oz cup with 2 tablespoons in the morning and then i sipped 16 ozs with one quarter cup of vinegar throughout the morning/afternoon then I went back to the 8 oz swig that evening. Although it really seemed to help the rest of the sinuses this front upper on the right remains stubborn. My ear on the right side is constantly filling up and throbbing and I have to keep blowing out my eustachian tube. I think maybe this has from the upper sinuses and infection from the upper right sinus?In that upper right area I get pounding and extreme spaciness which I believe increase as I take the vinegar. This morning i inhaled in steam 50/50 water/vinegar. It made me very spacy and the spaciness is obviously coming out of that upper right area. The spaciness is in different degrees and sometimes almost to the degree I cannot think. It makes my memory and concentration very bad as well. Am I doing the correct thing? Should I be drinking vinegar with water all day and at what strength?For how long? Also the steam seems to get up there. How often should i do that and should i maybe do pure vinegar as opposed to mixing it with water? . . please help. Thank You Mike

I didn't know what to do.I saw on your site about ACV did your suggested measurements of 2 tablespoons acv with 8 oz warm water 3x a day for 24hrs. Almost to the hour I was breathing really clearly and my sence of smell was coming back! I am so excited about this. Thank you so much for posting this suggestion :)
5945	97	6909	Reinventyourhealth  from Redding, Ca, Usa	2010-04-23 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I am a 53 yr old male and I have had sinus problems periodically for 10 years. Lately, they have been getting progressively worse and much more severe. The deciding factor for me to try one of the suggested remedies was when, just a few days ago, I experienced severe sinus blockage on the left side of my face and what I initially thought to be some dental problems as my cheek was swollen from the impacted sinus cavity. Anyway, I scanned the various remedies and tried the 50/50 mixture of ACV and purified water. I mixed up the solution and put it in to an unused nasal mister bottle. The suggestion was to pump 4-5 sprays in to each nostril. I knew it would sting with the 5% acidity of the ACV so I opted for 1 pump in each nostril to start. I was glad I did as it definitely stings for approx. 10 sec. I also chose to sniff my nose to get it further in to the blocked sinuses. If you can tough out the stinging, you should be quite pleased with the results. I actually ended up doing 4 pumps in each nostril just not all at once. Within a half hour my sinuses were starting to open up and the pain was subsiding in the upper jaw. Approximately 3 hours later and I was able to breath through my left nostril that was previously blocked. I can testify to the effectiveness of this treatment as it really cleared me up and saved me tremendous medical costs as this solution cost less than 25 cents to mix. I need to inform you,however, that prior to this treatment I tried the steaming method which consisted using 50/50 parts of ACV and water brought to a boil. It didn't seem to be working as effectively as I had hoped it would so I went to the aforementioned remedy. After my sinuses were under control I decided to dilute the mixture to a 1 part ACV to 2 part water and will now use as a sinus prevention program. Hope this information is helpful to all of you that suffer from sinuses.
5946	97	6910	Melanie from Portland, Or	2010-04-19 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	About a week ago, I was suffering from a VERY BAD sinus infection, so bad that my ear was causing me excrutiating(sp?) pain, I lost some of my hearing and my mucous was mixed with blood and would not stop draining. I am also one of the many in this country without health or dental insurance. So when I woke up with my ear bothering me even more, I searched for a natural cure for sinus infection and was directed to earth clinic. The main things I found to treat a sinus infection was steaming my sinuses( shower turned up all the way and sat in a steam filled bathroom for 15 minutes) hot tea with honey, and Apple Cider Vinegar. 2 Table spoons mixed with 8 oz of water 3 times a day. With the severaty(sp?) of my sinus infection, it did take a week to feel nearly 100% better! Since finding your website, I have been in Awe at how many remedies are out there. So thank you. I will be recomending this website to everyone I know. Thank You again for helping those in need with inexpensive natural remadies for those of us who need them.

Tried anti-biotics and all kinds of mucus thinning tablets without much effect. 2 tablespoons of ACV in 8 OZ of water did wonders. She did that for 3 days and all her sinus infections were gone in no time. It controlled the night time coughs as well. Thanks for posting this amazing remedy
5948	97	6912	Elvishscorpio from Wilkesboro, Nc	2010-03-30 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I had a really really bad sinus infection. With no health insurance I could not afford to go to the doctor, and grew really worried because my friend let a sinus infection go once, and the doctor told her that they can be really dangerous if left untreated- can cause brain aneurysms and blindness... I woke up one morning and my whole head hurt and I could not even focus my eyes... after taking a pain killer I looked you guys up and within 3 days of mixing honey, Organic apple cider vinegar, and hot tea 3 times daily I am better! People really need to know this so they are not giving the doctors and pharmaceutical companies even more money... Thank you so much. Works better than prescription antibiotics.
5949	97	6913	Roger from Bowling Green, Kentucky	2010-03-06 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I've been miserable for 5 days now...got hit with a cold and a sinus infection. I haven't taken any medication or treatment for my constant allergies etc in over 10 years. I just learned to deal with it. This time...after the pressure was so bad both ears felt like I was wearing cheap earplugs and could not sleep more than an hour at a time in a recliner...I bought a couple packages of Tylenol severe cold pills the next morning. No effect at all. Steam treatments would give slight relief as far as my stuffy nose, but nothing for any other symptoms. I finally wandered on the web and thank God for ACV and everyone's posts. In an hour and a half my right ear popped and I had real relief for the first time in nearly a week.

5962	97	6926	Cecilia from Vestavia, Alabama	2009-05-07 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	ACV cured my cronic sinus infections. I have had recurring sinus infections for years. Recently, I have been on antibiotics for 6 weeks, steriods for 10 days, deongestants at night and two different allergy medicines for the last 2 years. Two weeks after my last infection, I noticed the congestion and pain returning. Since I had gained 15 pounds in two weeks because of the steriods, I refused to go back to the Dr. to start the antibiotic and steriod treatment again. I started researching on the web for natural sinus infection cures and ran across this site.I was willing to try anything at this point. I had a bottle of H____ ACV in the cabinet. I started drinking 2 1/2 tablesspoons of it mixed into an 8oz glass of water 3 times a day. By the 2nd day I noticed that the pressure was gone and the congestion had lessened. It has been 3 days now and my sinuses are totally clear. I have stopped all of my medicines; the antihistamines, allergy pills and decongestants and feel better than I have in years. This has been a God send. I am going to the health food store to buy some undistilled ACV. If the store bought brand was able to do this, I can't wait to see what the undistilled version will do for me. Thank you!
5963	97	6927	Toinette from Long Island, N.Y. USA	2009-05-04 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Apple Cider Vinegar has changed my life, seriously. I've seen 4 different doctors this past year and been given different antibiotics by each one for my blocked sinus. I haven't felt well or had much energy for a couple of years due to the ongoing sinus problem that never has gotten cured. I quit drinking wine and all alcohol cause I read that can cause a lot of yeast. The last guy I saw was an ENT who put me on a z-pack for 1 week, to be followed by 1 month of Prednisone and another z-pack at the end of the treatment. I took the 1st dose of antibiotics and filled the prescription for the Prednisone but before taking it looked it up on the internet only to read a lot of really scary stuff about it. I decided not to take it and that night I found this site which I absolutely love! I started immediately with the AVC ( 2 Tbsp.) mixed with a tiny amount of juice and 1/4 tsp. baking soda and the rest of the glass (8 oz) filled with water. Within maybe half an hour I could breathe out of my right nostril which was impossible before. The CTscan showed total blockage on that side. So I've been doing this for about a month now, in the AM, sipping during the day, and again in the PM and my breathing is so much better and I don't wake up in the middle of the night anymore having to spray or put on a nose bandaid thing. I'm not cured yet but I believe I will be. I also started oil pulling last week and that also helps. I can actually blow my nose and stuff is coming out of the right side finally. It's dark yellow so I know it's an infection but I think with time it will be cured. I don't expect things to work overnight, though the avc did start having an effect pretty fast. I cured myself of cervical cancer years ago with macrobiotics. It took 3 months. So I'll be patient with this and also try to cut out things like sugar, flour, dairy which I know would help. I also tried the avc as a rinse after washing my face and it leaves your skin looking like glass! It's amazing. I'm 58 and so sick of trying new stuff for my skin that never seems to make a difference but this seems to work nicely. I'm so happy to have found this site with like minded people. I really do believe the body can heal itself with the right natural things.
5964	97	6928	Anne from Branford, CT USA	2009-04-22 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Thanks for all these great tips on using Apple Cider Vinegar to cure sinus infections. After 21 days on one of the strongest antibiotics, I still had a sinus infection. My doctor wanted to send me for a CAT Scan. After finding your site, I tried two things. I put 2-3 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar in 2-3 cups of water in a pan on the stove then put a towel over my head and inhaled the steam for about 10-15 mins. I did this three nights in a row and now I can breathe clearly, no more pressure and my headache is gone. It worked wonderfully. I also tried one cup of very warm water with a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar and some honey to kill the taste. I drank about 1/2 the cup for two days, so this may have helped as well.
5965	97	6929	Leigh from Andover, MA	2009-04-09 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	With pages and pages here tolling the virtues of ACV I decided to give it a try. I'm facing sinus surgery in a month and seem to have picked up a cold or little bug and my head is full of pressure and I feel pretty blah. I put a teaspoon of ACV into my neti pot (with sea salt) and poured it through - I only used 1/2 pot for each side because it *does* burn! But it wasn't totally unbearable. I also put 2 TBSP in ~8 oz. warm water and sipped it. While this didn't produce a lot of nasal discharge, it does seem to have relieved quite a bit of the pressure in my sinuses. I will try another dose at bedtime (about 5 hours after the first) and see how the night goes. However, I have nasal polyps in my ethmoid sinuses and I believe I will still have to have surgery to remove those and straighten my septum. But if anyone has any natural remedy that can shrink those polyps (I doubt anything will make them go away) I'd *love* to hear about it!
5966	97	6930	Serbella from St. Louis, Missouri/USA	2009-03-31 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Several days ago I developed a severe sinus infection, complete with dental pain that made me lie awake at night crying. I had sinus pressure on the left side of my face, and I could feel my sinuses draining down my throat. I was on the internet about an hour ago and I saw your site. Figured what the heck, the Aleeve wasn't doing anything to relieve the pain, and the decongestent was not working. I had a bottle of Apple Cider Vinegar and I went a little overboard: I put in one ladleful of AVC in a tall glass of warm water, which I believe probably evens out to three or four tablespoons of AVC. Hey,I was desperate. I drank it all down in one sitting. Now, forty five minutes later, the dental pain is just about gone, and my throat doesn't feel raw anymore. I know you said to use it before the onset of the infection, but the only time I've ever feel this good this quickly was when I was using prescription drugs. I'm a believer in ACV now. Will follow up later with at least two more glasses of the stuff. Thank you!
5967	97	6931	J. from Alexandria, MN	2009-03-31 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I was surfing the net looking for sinus infection remedies when I came across this site and read how many people were for this treatment. I tried it (I used 2 teaspoonfulls) and have to admit was a little sick to my stomach afterward, but I already feel much better. I also had a sore throat which has gotten better since taking ACV(not quite gone yet though). When I do another treatment I will try the honey suggestion someone made on this site as I think that will make it taste better. I am grateful I found this site!
5968	97	6932	Donna from Frederick, MD	2009-03-23 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV) treated my sinus infection. I got bad colds for a week with yellow mucus. I had a head pressure and headache when I got up in the morning. I used netipot with salt to get rid of colds. I also took "Cold Eeze" to reduce the severity of colds which was helpful. I searched for a remedy and I found this web site and I decided to try ACV. Wow! It did help to make my head pressure and headache disappeared. It also cleared out my thick mucus membrance in my throat. I was able to breathe better. Thanks for your suggestion.

It was 1:00 am when I googled sinus pressure natural cures and your site came up. I read the feedback and left the house at 1:15am to go to a local all night store to get some ACV. I immediately drank 1/4 cup and tried the steaming. Within 10 minutes my nose was running and the pressure had diminished. I am going to stay up a little longer and steam again and I can't thank you enough for this GREAT natural remedy. Oh, by the way I had been on an antibiotic for 7 days at this point and taking otc decongestants. Nothing helped as much as the ACV. I will never be without it!!!

I'm not one to believe everything I read on the internet, but the strength of your numbers gave me the courage to try. Last November I was suffering from a dreaded sinus infection. I'm fed up with antibiotics, so in desperation I googled and found you guys! I put one to two tablespoons ACV in warm water, added a little honey and drank it. Within 30 minutes, I was feeling better. I repeated three times a day over two days, and I was cured! I just repeated this last week when I was suffering from a cold that wouldn't let go. Everyone at work was getting sinus infections with this one, but not me! You folks are the best. Thank you thank you.
5970	97	6934	April from Gaffney, South Carolina	2009-02-03 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I've been suffering from a sinus infection for about a week now. I had pain in the right side of my nose, ear pain, and my upper teeth would ache. I could not breathe at all, so I was losing sleep and feeling really bad through out the day. So I googled home remedies for sinus infections and clicked on the earth clinc site. I read lots of feedback on how ACV helped tons of people, so I thought why not try it. I happend to have some in the fridge so I mixed two tablespoons of ACV with some water, and 15mins later, I can actually breathe through my nose! The pain in my nose is less. Thank you earth clinic! You've saved me a trip to the doctors office that I really could not afford. I strongly recommend everyone use this for their sinus infections!

I was up all night and i just could not sleep and needed some relief......This ACV really really works. I take two shots one at night and in the morning when I awake. I have nine year old who suffers as well; well not anymore thanks to ACV and earthclinic.
5972	97	6936	Doreen from Virginia Beach, VA	2009-01-25 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I just tried this with a combination of yogic alternate nostril breathing: breath IN first nostril (block the other) and OUT the second, then breath IN second nostril and OUT first. One side is usually more blocked by mucus than the other so I found it more effective to help unblock it: while breathing in put fingertips on cheekbones and pull the flesh away from the nose. I repeated this over and over, with a towel over my head. I stop often to blow my nose and massage my face (sinus cavities). I also put the pan back on the heat a couple of times. The hotter the solution (1c water - 1 c ACV) the stronger and more effective the vapors. I will re-use the solution.
5973	97	6937	Kathy from Edmond, OK	2009-01-22 00:00:00	BETTER BUT NOT CURED	2	0	I have had a recurring sinus infection now off and on for a year. I am so tired of taking antibiotics for this to return within a week. I finally searched the internet and found this site. I immediately called my husband who was at the store and had him buy ACV. I sipped a couple of tablespoons last night and again this morning. I also swished with Olive Oil for 15 minutes (all I could handle) and immediately upon spitting it out, I got the "heaves" and so much congestion came up! I can't say the oil left over in my mouth wasn't the culprit of me gagging but I think it was the combination of both. I am going to try this over the next several days and will report back with the results. I am quite excited and expecting it to get worse before it gets better.

I came across the use of using ACV, and since my boyfriend was at the health food store for me anyway, I texted him and asked him to also bring home some ACV. He mentioned this to the lady at the store, and she said she SWEARS by ACV, for a multitude of things.
5975	97	6939	Ana from Huntington Beach, CA	2009-01-10 00:00:00	NAY	1	0	My sinus infections had all but gone away with dietary changes and other natural remedies. However after indulging in dairy and wheat, chocolate, etc. over the holidays I have a whopper of an infection. Apple Cider Vinegar usually helps but not this time. The problem is that it helps the congestion a little, but then causes the post nasal drip of mucus into my throat and lungs. So, to get the nose relief, my throat and lungs get worse. Any ideas on how to get rid of the congestion in my throat and lungs. Nothing is working for that at all. I've tried many natural products, homeopathic, herbal, compresses, steam, etc. Nothing, Yikes!!! Help!!!
5976	97	6940	Mich123 from Batavia, Illinois	2008-12-04 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have had a sinus infection on and off for the last month and on Monday I was so upset because both nostrils were glued shot with thick mucus, I couldnt breath and even Afrin (I try not to use) wouldnt work for more than a few hours. I came on line and read about the ACV and had 2 Tbl in a glass of warm water and some honey and within a half an hour my throat was cleared of the mucus and one side of my nose opened. I was able to sleep for the first time in weeks! I have drank this tonic twice a day for the last 3 days and my sinus feel about 95% back to normal. I am soooo happy I found this site and learned about ACV. I cant wait to check out the rest of the helpful advice. Thanks to all!
5977	97	6941	MoOf from Englewood, Colorado	2008-11-10 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	After two days of feeling like a zombie from a sinus infection I stumbled across this site and the ACV suggestion and decided that I had nothing to loose as I had some Apple Cider Vinegar in the house already. I decided to try mixing 1 tablespoon ACV with about 8 ounces of warm tap water. I was a little hesitant to drink it as I thought I would more than likely vomit from the taste. But after sitting there with the cup under my nose trying to get up the guts to just drink it, I felt my sinuses starting to loosen from just breathing in the vapors. Still afraid of the taste I decided to drink it as fast as I could to just get it over with. I must say that the taste is something I will never get used to but the results were wonderful. Instantly the pressure in my head vanished, and the mucous stopped flowing from my nose. A few minutes later it felt as though my sinuses were completely dry and free of mucous. Though this feeling did not last, the amount of mucous had decreased considerably. Three hours later I was still feeling a lot better but still had the scratchy feeling in the back of my throat, and some mucous and pressure returning I mixed up another glass at the same ratio and this time drank it slowly. I can still say that it is a taste that I don't enjoy but after drinking it slowly my throat and nose are completely cleared and it has been about 4 hours since my last dose. Thank you for taking the time to host a site such as this. I have not tried the oil pulling yet but definitely intent to.

Still have sinus infection. Tried the natural way, but it looks like I will have to go to the doctors. I tried and it didn't work.
5979	97	6943	Avery from Great Falls, Montana	2008-08-19 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	First off, I'm a HUGE skeptic with natural remedies. After two rounds of expensive antibiotics I was still having yellow/green drainage and my entire face was so painful, I couldn't lay my cheek against the pillow. I broke down and cried trying to figure out how I was going to come up with more money for another antibiotic. Instead I decided to do a search and found all of the comments about ACV. I sent my husband to pick up a bottle of it for me because I was so sick I couldn't move. I really didn't have faith that it was going to do anything but with the pain I was in, I was desperate to try. Once he got home, I immediately took in 2 tablespoons in pure water. Within an hour I began draining more little stuff out, and as the hours pass, I kid you not that really bad pain I was in started to decrease in my forehead and cheeks. Even that pain and grinding ache above my teeth was dissipating. Another thing that surprised me was, I felt a little better all over my body. Those aches in my neck and every where had lessoned. Four hours later, I intuitively poured out 1/4 cup to 12 oz of pure water and drank that down. About 5 hours later, the pain had really significantly decreased. I could talk and smile. I can see that the mucous is changing into a more whitish pale yellow instead of the bright yellow green. It's drying up a little. I'm reporting this about 14 hours after the first dose. I'm not sure how I'll be in a few days but I can definitely say my pain is surprisingly ..almost gone and I feel much more like my old self. This is definitely worth a try if you're out there and suffering like I was. Good luck and Good health to you all.
5981	97	6945	H.T. from Charlotte, North Carolina	2008-07-30 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I am truly amazed at how effective acv really is. I have been a sufferer of sinus problems for nearly 10 years now. I feel like I have tried everything. Recently, I was down and depressed because I was dealing with another episode for 4 days straight. I could barely make it through the day. And suddenly the light bulb went off...why not search the internet for a home remedy. Well, thank the lord. I am a former caterer so I always have apple cider vineger in my pantry. After reading this site I went down to the kitchen and did a 2 ounce shot. I figured if I could do tequila this would be a cakewalk. In less than an hour I felt relief. I actually slept like a baby without the use of a sleep aid. I did another shot in the a.m. and I felt even better as the day went on. Best day I have had in a very long time. I cant wait to share this with friends and family who also suffer. Oh, it always curbed my appetitie all day. I am trying to shed 15 lbs I picked up this past year. And I am sure acv will be a huge help. I'll keep you posted on the progress. Yippee!
5982	97	6946	Vitalia from Boulder, CO	2008-07-15 00:00:00	WORKED TEMPORARILY	3	0	Well, after reading about ACV on your website along with all the positive feedback I decided to give it a shot. I have been suffering from a sinus infection that just won't go away. I've tried everything from colloidal silver to nettie pots, garlic soups, eucalyptus inhalation steam baths, you name it, I did it. And so here comes ACV. I drank 1/4 cup of it with hot water the first night and yes it worked, my head ache felt better, my face was relived of some pain and my nose cleared up, not all the way though. Well this is day three and I have to come to a conclusion that it is no longer working for me. My throat hurts again, my head is pounding and so is my face, and my nose is completely clogged. I've been drinking two cups a day for the last two days and I am drinking it right now and nothing!!! I really hoped this would be my cure. I am breastfeeding and refuse to take meds of any kind. So, at this point not sure what my next step should be. Wishing you all luck with your bodily ailments!
5983	97	6947	Cindi from Anchorage, United States	2008-07-13 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have suffered from sinus infections for more than 20 years. About 1 1/2 years ago, after battling a 2 year infection, I had surgery. The surgery helped for about 4 months, then the pressure and congestion came back. Since the surgery, I use a saline rinse daily to flush out my sinuses and also installed air purifiers in the house. I was doing everything right and I was still having problems. I had constant pain and pressure under my eyes that sinus rinses were not helping. I had a sinus infection last fall and my doc said if I continued to have problems, it was time for another cat scan and more meds (noooooo!!!) For the past couple of weeks, I could feel an infection starting up. Because of all of infections I have had, my body is now immune to three antibiotics. Not wanting to start down that road again, I searched the internet for natural cures and found this website. I have to admit I was skeptical that ACV could cure my infection, but I was desperate. I figured if it didn't work, I could use it to make salad dressing. Yesterday, I took 3 tablespoons ACV in an 8 oz. glass of warm water at noon. It wasn't the most pleasant tasting stuff, but I chugged it down. Around 8 pm, I put 1/2 teaspoon ACV into 8 oz water and used it as a sinus rinse. Owwww! The right side of my face where the infection is, burned so bad! After I recovered from the rinse, I drank a second dose (and added a little honey for taste) around 8 pm. About an hour later, I was shocked. The pain under my eyes was gone and I could breathe thru my nose! This morning I drank another dose, and didn't notice any change in the pain in my cheekbones. As a matter of fact, it got worse as the day went on (probably the infection from under my eyes was pooling in my cheekbone area). At 5 pm, I repeated the sinus rinse only using 1/4 teaspoon ACV to 8 oz water. Much more tolerable and it seemed to only burn in the areas I could feel the infection. I pinched my nose and held the solution in as long as I could stand it. I then drank another dose. It is now 2 hours later and I can only feel a slight tenderness in my cheekbones. I am absolutely stunned how fast the ACV worked. At this rate, I should have this infection kicked in another day or two. I haven't felt this good in years. I plan on continuing using the ACV every day as a preventative measure. I can't thank you enough. Everyone's experiences here with ACV is what convinced me to try it. Thanks again.
5984	97	6948	Deeva from Atlanta, GA	2008-06-19 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have bad allergies and it got to the point where it was causing me to have an ongoing sinus infection. I would wake up every morning with a dry throat and mucus backed up in my throat, having to cough it up every morning. I read on the internet about ACV curing sinus infections so I started taking a tablespoon every night and gradually my sinus infection got better and better and is now gone. I still take, some nights I forget but the nights I do forget I don't wake up the next morning with an infection. Needless to say its effects are long lasting and not just temporary based on usage!
5985	97	6827	Jaimi from Orlando, FL	2008-06-06 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	WOW! I have come to love the wonderful product of ACV. I have had severe allergies and sinus problems since I could walk. Chronic bronchitis, sinusitis, tonsilitis (they have lonce since been removed), rhinitis, etc... I have always taken prescription medication. However I am 8 mos pregnant and have not been able to take anything but over the counter Tylenol products. For the past 3 days I have been down and out with a severe sinus migraine, congestion and pressure. Nothing worked and I am sleep deprived! Adding these symptoms to 8mos of pregnancy spells MISERY for sure. I was desperate so I hopped online and what do you know? I found the same product that cured my husband of his pesky wart will also clear my sinuses. I only wished I found this info sooner! I took 1 tbsp of ACV with 8oz of water and downed. Then I made a mixture and put it in my veggie steamer (ACV is also a great residue cleaner) and sat over it for about 5mins. Everything started to clear up within the hour. I then rinsed with saline solution and I can breathe out of both nostrils! My headache is almost gone and the pressure almost nil! Oh and by the way the ACV steam bath is great for oily skin. I noticed a difference immediately after the face bath. I was then curious to see if this was a known rememdy for acne/skin problems and sure enough it is!!! In fact, Earth Clinic was the first hit. I am amazed that such a simple, inexpensive product can do so much. Thank you dearly for this site.
5986	97	6949	Karen from Biloxi, Mississippi	2008-05-26 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Went to the doctor for a sinus problem and ears beginning to stop up. Of course, he prescribed 10 days of Augmentin, Allegra, Singuliar, etc. Had enough sense not to take the Singuliar and Allegra just makes blood pressure go up. Any antibiotic usually also gives me a yeast thing. That's another story to deal with now. Yesterday mucas started again and ears began to stop up, mucas draining down the throat also makes it sore. After reading this site I started 2 Tbs. of ACV with The Mother yesterday, was all ready taking garlic caps. This morning I awoke and my mucas problem is totally better and ears are popping. I can actually breathe a lot better. I'm really happy and will continue ACV. I also mix 1 tsp. salt and 1/4 tsp. baking soda with 2 cups warm water and wash out my nasal passages. Natural is the way to go!

This one started the same way...I swear this is true. I called my husband he bought lemons, organic ACV and the rest was up to me. I boiled water and steamed over it for 15 minutes in a bowl with 2 table spoons. Then I drank the water, lemon honey mixture and 45 minutes later I can taste, breath and smell 50% better and my ears finaly popped within an hour! I feel so much Better!! WHOOOOOOOOOOHOOO..This is not mind over matter...this worked!

By the 9th week, I contracted an eye infection, had severe upper jaw ache and toothache, had severe nasal congestion which kept me awake at night combined with persistent headaches and lots of green mucus, sore body and I was very listless. I was on various allopathic medication - but nothing helped - and did not even provide relief to my symptoms!! I then came across this website. It was either surgery OR apple cider vinegar.

The pain is starting to decipate and my nosal cavity doesn't feel like acid is being poured in there. I still have a fever (I'm heading for the aspiren), but I feel soooo much better than I was when I read these articles only 1/2 hour ago. Thanks for the heads up.

5994	97	6828	Pam from Flower Mound, TX	2008-03-12 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I must admit- I had little faith but was desperate. After three rounds of antibiotics and still constant congestion/ sinus infection, I became addicted to Afrin. Using it twice daily cleared my nose enough for me to make calls at work and sleep at night but after only two weeks, I had to increase to 4x's a day to stay clear. I realized this was a major problem and began searching for alternative solutions. After reading the earthclinic site, I threw out the Afrin, purchased apple cider vinegar and a Neti Pot (since lots of friend have been recommending it too). My nose was so clogged the Neti Pot was not effective- the water had no where to do. So, I mixed the one TBS. of ACV with 8 oz. of water and chugged it. I haven't been able to taste anything for over a week but could still feel the bitter tingle on my tounge. I was disappointed when I didn't feel relief within the hour. The evening passed and I realized as I went to lay down for the night- I could breathe through my nose. While it wasn't totally clear- I could sleep with my mouth closed- without using the dreaded Afrin! I followed the same procedure the next day and by the second night- I was breathing totally clear and feeling great! GOD BLESS YOU earth clinic. My taste buds are back and the ACV is terrible but I don't care- it's worth it x's 100 for the relief I finally feel!!! After reading the other benifits ACV offers- I have recommended it and your site to many family and friends. Thanks again!
5995	97	6957	Julie from Tulsa, Oklahoma	2008-03-04 00:00:00	NAY	1	0	Is it possible to take too much acv? I have started getting sinus infections every time I get a cold, so this time I decided that I better not go on antibiotics, but let my body learn again to fight this off. After about the third day I was miserable so I got online looking for a way to survive this. The acv with honey and baking soda is working very well. After I take 2T acv/1T honey/1/4 bs, I feel better in about 30 minutes, but after another hour or so, I feel bad again and want to dring some more. Could it be bad to drink too much?

I wanted to sing the praises of a couple of these remedys that I tried and they worked!! I tried apple cider vinegar a couple months ago when I had a sinus infection (after having a cold for a couple weeks before the sinus infection set in) and was tired of the headaches and feeling miserable. I took 1/8 cup apple cider vinegar mixed in fruit juice (tried it with water but couldnt stand the taste). I drank this a couple times a day for 10 days and the sinus infection went away. A couple months before that I had a bad head cold - sinusus all stuffed up - felt like there was a river running through my head and could not breathe out of my nose. I drank the tomato tea recommended and it cleared up my nose so I could breathe again. Drank it for about a week a couple times a day and it cured me.
5996	97	6958	Gislain from Phoenix, AZ	2008-02-22 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Earlier this week, I was diagnosed with a bacterial infection in the back of my throat and was prescribed antibiotics...which was a hit to my health ego because I eat well but somehow caught this bug. Along with this, I developed this awful sinus infection. Horrible headaches, watery eyes, no sleep, and non-stop discomfort accompanied this! I went to the health food store and bought some nasal spray and sublingual sinus relief tablets, both of which didn't work. While suffering at work, I came across this web site and read about Apple Cider Vinegar. While excited to try this for my Sinus infection, I ate an apple as a snack. Within an hour, my sinus symptoms decreased by 60%. When I came home, I had some ACV with water and within another hour, the symptoms decreased some more. Right now, it's almost time for bed and my Sinus Infection is 90% gone and just three hours ago, I was suffering!! The apple helped and the ACV sealed the deal on this Sinus stuff! Awesome!

I had a sinus infection on and off for the last 15 years! I have tried everything and more from the regular md's including pain pills for years to get rid of that horrible head ache around my eyes and cheek bones. A couple of years ago while walking, I Met a man selling a book about Cancer cures/prevention. he had published the book himself and i was interested in prevention, and what he had to say. He told me that all Humans and animals would benefit greatly by drinking and BATHING in ORGANIC APPLE CIDER VINEGAR WITH THE MOTHERS... I found this to be very interesting and decided to do my own experiments and research, I have a dog who was beginning to get mange on her hind knee it was red and irritaded the vets wanted to give her some horrible medicine and she was clearly not feeling well.I held him over the sink and poured the Vinegar strait from the bottle over her infected knee she squirmed a bit probably from the stinging but a second later that smart pooch put her leg on my chest so i could at it better (as though she knew i was gonna fix her) after the first time it was 80% better and in two days that mange was gone! so I took a bath using the vinegar i probably used a quart as I buy it in gallon jugs ...I could not believe how I felt after one bath..."Reborn" is the word that comes to mind. after that one bath I began to take it orally, in the morning or anytime i had heart burn another ailment of mine...The ACV has worked wonders,also it took My skin tags off and made my skin and hair so much brighter.i also only use coconut oil for moisturizing and a small amount in my hair for dryness.
6000	97	6962	Paul from Hurley, Mississippi	2008-01-20 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have suffered recurrent sinus infections for at least 12 years now and have always taken antibiotics and decongestants that made me ill but I would endure the illness to geet rid of the infection, well that is until it landed me in the hospital with severe dehydration. The next visit to the doctor, he put me on almost the same medicines and after taking 3 doses, I ended up looking for a natural method to cure a sinus infection. When I heard of ACV twice a day, I thought, what can it hurt. Used grocery store brand for three days and saw some improvement, so I then purchased some Organic with the Mother and in 5 days I have almost completely cleared up all my sinus congestion so I can sleep well and I have also noticed other benefits such as more energy and some weight loss. I really wish I had opened up my mind 10 years ago. Great and Thanks for the information on your site.

I came across this website looking for a treatment for my recurrent sinus infections that no antibiotics ever took care of, and based on all the reviews I tried the ACV treatment. It worked in ONE DAY!! I can't believe it, because I am a doctor, and am a little wary of home remedies. I did the 2 tbsp in 8 oz of water, and in one day I didn't have as much sinus pressure, and by the second day the constant drainage from the infection had stopped, and my migraines which I have had on and off for years also have not returned. In addition, my bad breath from the infection is gone, and I don't have to constantly be chewing gum anymore! I definitely will be doing this treatment everyday for a very long time, and I've found if you eat just a little bit of bread or crackers with the ACV you don't get heartburn. To anyone who's suffering from a sinus infection, just try this, it doesn't cost you much money at all, and if you've suffered from sinus infections as much as I have, you owe it to yourself to give this a shot!!! Best wishes to all!
6002	97	6964	Adrienne from Phoenix, Arizona	2008-01-11 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I had the beginning of a sinus infection - i used to smoke so i would get them a lot, so i know just how it starts - i called out of work and was dreading the onset of a possible progression to an upper respiratory infection and was equally unhappy about possibly hitting the Urgent Care for $50 and getting antibiotics, which my body does not really enjoy at all. So a friend told me that he heard someone he knew used Oregano spray or something in his nose to clear an infection. I had never heard of it - so i researched it and found earthclinic.com. From there i used some apple cider vinegar that my husband had left (from his failed weight loss attempt) in the fridge and my friend drove me to the store and i bought good quality Oregano Oil. Using the Apple Cider Vinegar, 16oz. water with 4 tbsp of vinegar and 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda and sipping it all day ensured i was only partly stuff for maybe 2 or 3 days, and the only time my mucous was off color was first thing in the morning - the Oregano Oil helped me breathe and i took that at 4 drops in 4 oz of water every 2 hours for the 1st 5 or 6 days, then less frequently. It never progressed to my chest and i have basically gotten over a sinus infection in record time! Now i drink the ACV (8oz water, 2 tbsp ACV, 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda) every day because i have hopes that it will help heal my skin (random adult acne that has worsened considerably since moving to the desert), and i still take the oregano oil once per day as well as dropping one drop on my toothbrush before brushing in order to super sterilize my mouth and possibly fight gum disease and all that stuff. I wanted to try oil pulling but haven't been able to find unrefined sesame oil, which is the sort i intend to use once i can find it! this site rocks. I will keep you updated on any skin miracles.
6003	97	6965	Caitlin from Covington, GA	2007-12-22 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have a bi-annual habit of getting sinus infections...and for the past 2 or 3 days i've had my worst one yet. was skeptical to try drinking cayenne pepper. I read many posts about the ACV remedy...and I boiled a coffee cup full of water and stirred in 2 tablespoons of ACV...and I felt a slight, instant relief. I'm determined to be rid of this by Christmas...so we'll see what happens in the morning! Thanks Everyone!
6006	97	6968	Stella from Omaha, NE	2007-10-05 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Hello! I have been dealing with chronic sinus problems and infections for almost 20 years now. I've had three sinus operations (two which did help some for a while) and I've been on just about every antibiotic there is available. I had just finished my first round of the latest antibiotic treatment, when I realized my infection was not completely gone. So, with a heavy sigh, I once again contacted my doctor to get some more medication. Feeling very frustrated and tired with having to deal with this for so many years, I decided to do some research on-line for other options and new treatments. I found the EarthClinic website and the ACV remedy options. I was a little skeptical at first, but after reading all the positive responses, I decided it wouldn't hurt for me to give it a try. I started doing the ACV remedies on Tuesday, Oct. 2nd, and after just the first day I noticed a HUGE difference in how my sinuses felt! Within 1/2 an hour of drinking my first mixture of 2 tbsp of ACV with 8oz of water, my sinuses started to drain and the pressure and headache starting going away! I followed up with doing the 1/4 cup of ACV in 16oz of water and sipped it all morning at work. Later that evening, I did another 2 tbsp of AVC with 8oz of water again. I slept great that evening and woke up feeling great the next morning! No headache, no pressure, and more energy than I had had in a long time. I've continued doing the same thing all this week, and today, Oct. 2nd I have more energy and I feel great! I'm going to finish out the week by doing the same treatments and slowly taper them off after a week. I'll have to admit, the taste is not the greatest, but it's a very small price to pay for something that works so great! Not to mention the fact that it's so much less expensive as well compared to all the prescriptions and over-the-counter meds that I've been taking for years! From now on, when I start to get a cold or feel like my sinuses are heading towards another infection, I definitely will start using the ACV remedy again! SPECIAL NOTE: Carefully check the label of the Apple Cider you purchase. Be sure you get the pure Apple Cider Vinegar and not the types that have water added that dilutes it, or have what's labeled as artificial "flavorings".
6007	97	6969	Henry from Lambertville, New Jersey	2007-10-03 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have had chronic sinus problems for years now. Antibiotics work but a week after I take them my problems come back. I have been desperate for holistic solutions. I use a neti pot daily which helps alot. Today I saw this web site and thought I would try ACV and see how it did. With in a half hour my swelling went down and I finally had a LARGE amount of discharge within that time. I am totally surprised how fast a reaction I had to this. Growing up my grandmother and great aunt would take ACV and honey twice a day, I thought it was silly but now i'm wishing I tried this sooner, it really has worked. I'm gonna keep taking the ACV and see how it works over time. I get a sinus infection to some degree just about every month, I'm fed up. Its amazing how something as simple as ACV can have such a quick response time.
6008	97	6953	Julie from Houston, Texas	2007-09-02 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I usually get 3 sinus infections a year that start off as allergies then my sinuses clog and the drainage goes down the back of my throat and down into my chest. Then it goes into full blown bronchitis. I can't take antibiotics anymore - I took so many doses over the past 10 years I don't think they work on me anymore. Today - with a clogged head, nasal drainage, stuffy nose, sore throat, chest cough - I tried ACV. Did the 2 Tbls. with water - chugged it and it does seem to be helping me. Within 1 hour the sinus pressure diminished and all my drainage stopped. I'm going to use ACV with hot tea next time - the taste is pretty gross but if this stuff works - I'll continue to drink it! So far it's helping! I'm the queen of major sinus infections and bronchitis so if this cure works on me it's gotta work on others! Life is miserable when you've got a sinus infection that's for sure! Good luck to anyone who uses ACV!
6009	97	6970	Darian from Springfield, Missouri	2007-08-29 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	It's been a few months since I gave an update, however, the results are simply amazing. I take raw unfiltered ACV, 1/8 cup 3x a day. My sinus infections are all history, but that's not the reason I'm writing. About 2 weeks ago, I stepped on the scales. I have lost 30 pounds. I weighed 220 pounds in April, and I now weigh 190. Of course, the ACV isn't the only thing I do, however it was definitely the catalyst in giving me the energy to move forward. I drink a gallon or more of pure water a day. I eat whatever I want, whenever I want, and I'm still losing weight. Most of the weight (about 20 pounds), was lost during a period when I was doing NO exercise. I've lost 2 waist sizes. My wife is jealous!!! I keep telling her what she needs to do, but she says the thought of drinking ACV is just too disgusting. So, she gets to watch me buy a new wardrobe in a few weeks. Thank you EarthClinic for being here when I needed you back in April. You have truly changed my life. In addition, I've spread the news about the life altering experiences I have had through this site, so it's touched even more people. Keep the faith all, and remember... none of this worked "overnight". It took 3 days of ACV to lose my initial severe sinus infection. And if I go more than 3 days without using the ACV, I can tell a HUGE difference... as the sinuses start plugging up again, and I start getting tooth pain. I will drink ACV for the rest of my life! God willing, it'll be a long one. :)
6010	97	6971	Tracy from Phoenix, AZ	2007-08-15 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I've had this horrible sinus infection for weeks now. I have a long history of them but have been able to keep it under control for the past few years... though I still have difficulty with my sinuses, I am generally able to keep them draining enough that an infection doesn't fester. Anyway, for the past month or so, I've felt awful and haven't understood the flare up. So, here I come, looking for some kind of hope and find the info about apple cider vinegar. Now, I know that ACV is great stuff, but hadn't realized that it helped sinuses. So, as soon as I read about it, I went to the kitchen and gulped down 2T of it with 8oz of water. I am sooo pleased to say that my sinuses immediately began to drain - yucky thick mucous down my throat - but, hey, that is a relief with what I've been feeling! The pressure is somewhat relieved already!!! I'm so excited! What's more, I then read on and found the ice cream theory... And, without much surprise, I am sure enough able to link my recent sinus troubles to two rounds of ice cream! I had not eaten ice cream with "flavors" such as these in a long time prior to this, so it really fits for me! My troubles all started with a trip to COLDSTONE Creamery and shortly thereafter worsened upon consumption of some CARVEL brand ice cream cake!!!
6011	97	6972	Cindy from Morristown, NJ	2007-08-14 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I am SO excited! I have had a sinus infection now for about a week which came on as a result of a common cold. And to top it off, I'm pregnant, so taking medication is out of the question for me. Of course, that's not why I'm excited. I'm excited because I found this website that told me about apple cider vinegar. I have been drinking 2 Tbsps twice a day now for 2 days followed by 2 glasses of water (about 16 oz). I tell you, my sinus infection is GONE. This makes me so happy because I have suffered from chronic sinus infections for over 7 years now. I have taken many different antibiotics and gone through many different procedures to help alleviate them, but nothing has worked as well or as FAST as this totally natural remedy. I wish I would have looked this up sooner! I also delved a little surther into the website and found a recipe for Tomato Tea which I've been drinking before going to bed. It tastes pretty good, actually, and I really think it helps to clear my nasal passages. I also have been oil pulling as the website suggests. I don't know if that's doing any good, and it really turns my stomace, so I don't know if I'll continue with it, but I will as long as I can. Thank you SO much for letting the world know about this stuff.. it's important! I have been telling all my friends.
6012	97	6973	Dawn from Johnstown, PA	2007-08-07 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have had sinus infections since I first became pregnant at the age of 22 (I'm now 36) I have tried EVERYTHING you can possibly think of...antibiotics, STRONGER antibiotics, saline sprays,steam, CAT scans just to be on the safe side....outside of physically banging my head off the walls, I have tried it all. I was at the point where, and not really wanting to do this,I was going to talk to a dr. about having an operation for it. So thinking this is my last chance before I do something drastic I came across this site. Let me tell you....I feel wonderful. I did the ACV all day yesterday and this is the first morning, in a very LONG time, that I did NOT wake up with a massive headache. I can absolutely feel something is working in there.I feel like I may be able to function today. BUT the only problem I am having is that the ACV is giving me horrible gas and I am running to the bathroom within 30 mins of drinking it. Am I doing something wrong? I am only using 1/4 cup ACV and a full glass of water. I haven't seen anyone else write of this problem so just thought maybe I'm not doing it right, not eating enough or doing it too often....Any info on this is appreciated. My next venture is taking the Black Strap Molassas. I hear THAT does wonderful things too.
6013	97	6974	Madeline from Little Falls, MN	2007-07-12 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Yesterday was day 4 of sinus agony. I wanted to avoid the local clinic because the doctors there treat patience who use home natural cures like neurotic wack-jobs. So instead of subjecting myself to their condescention I logged on to your website and made a ACV cocktial. Tasted nasty but within 15 minutes the pressure disappated so much that my ear popped and I could hear again. Within an hour I was 80% better, by morning I was pain-free. There is still slight congestion but I will continue on with the ACV treatments. I also appreciated the information on sinus sprays and over the counter allergy pills and the side effects. I knew they weren't good but now I have new options to try.
6014	97	6975	Dayna from Pendergrass, Georgia	2007-07-03 00:00:00	NAY	1	0	i had a terrible sinus infection and decided to try the apple cider vinegar remedy. I read all the feedback from others and it seemed great. But, i think i might not have did it correctly because i got the worse stomach ache i have ever had in my life, accompanied by nausea and finally vomiting. No one else complained of this so i figured it was me. What do you guys think? ps, did not help with sinus infection either
6015	97	6976	David from Fort Worth, Texas	2007-06-26 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I started using the acv today at about 10:00 am. I had a cold last week and of course it turned into a sinus infection like it always does. So I said to myself here we go again witha $25 dollar trip to the allergist and a $60 dollar prescrition for anti-biotics. I am tired of sinus infections and hate them worse than any other ailment I've ever experienced. I get about 4 or 5 a year. Anyway, I started a search for natural cures and came across the vinegar cure which I have never heard of before. I immediately tried it right here at work. Luckily we have a cafeteria at work so I told the kitchen staff to give me about a 1/4 cup of the stuff. I gagged it down and wow my sinuses started feeling better almost immediatley. I have been doing the sinus irrigation also and that works great. As a chronic sinus sufferer for about 5 years now I am willing to try anything to get rid of these infections or prevent them without the use of the dreaded anti-biotics. So far so good with the irrigation and acv remedy. I will continue use forever as long as it works.
6016	97	6977	Rena from Ossining, NY	2007-05-30 00:00:00	NAY	1	0	I battle sinus infections about 3 times a year. I just went through a body detox plan for a week to remove chemicals from my body & wouldn't you know, I got a sinus infection on my 7th day of detox. I really didn't want to take antibiotics. I found this site & thought that this was a sign that I didn't need antibiotics. No such luck. I tried the ACV while irrigating with a saline solution. Basically when your mucous is green, it is bacterial. Bacteria multiplies at such a rate i think it would be almost impossible to knock it out of your system. So i am sad to report that i have to go on antibiotics to get some relief. BUT...i will continue with the ACV & irrigation to perhaps speed up the process.
6017	97	6978	Adry from Harrisburg, PA	2007-05-07 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	So I developed this awful sinus infection after getting the flu. The pressure was awful with intense bouts of pain when bending down or coughing. After a couple of days I went desperate to the doctor requesting some meds for relief, she prescribed me an antibiotic. I hate antibiotics and try to take them only when inevitable. So I found this website, bought some apple cider vinegar and wow did it work! It made me sneeze a few times after drinking it and my nose became runny. After a couple of days the pain was totally gone! Also I slept as a baby because my nose is was no longer congested. So I would like to spread the word on this great remedy. Before heading for the antibiotics try this first!
6018	97	6979	Nicole from South Salem, NY	2007-05-06 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I woke up with yet another dreaded sinus infection, my third in 3 months. I quickly went online, and came upon this site. Skeptical, but desperate, I went out to the kitchen, drank some commercial ACV, and went back to bed. By the end of the day, my fever broke, and I slept through the night. The next morning, I was feeling 90% better. I went to my local Mrs. Greens health food store and bought organic ACV w/ the "mother", and continued to drink ACV cocktails that day. By the middle of the day I was back outside walking and enjoying the day. In 1 day- I went from feling ill, sore throat, achy and all- to feeling fine! Amazing! Normally my infections linger for 3-6 days, and knock me off my feet. I normally have a stuffy nose which lasts for days so that I cant breathe well or taste food. Again- I am amazed! I was skeptical- but am now a believer and a ACV fan! - As is my husband. I will continue to use it daily, and hope that I won't have to suffer from any more sinus infections! Thank you
6019	97	6980	Sherry from Huntsville, Alabama	2007-05-03 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I had an ongoing battle with sinus infections. I hate taking medicine but finally gave in and went to the doctor. It took two different kinds of medicine but after 2 weeks I was cured... Two days later a friend brought over a milkshake and the next day I had the sinus infection back. Out of desperation I googled and discovered earth clinic and the apple cider vinegar remedy.My husband had a gallon of apple cider vinegar with the "mother". That day I took the correct dosage three times and that night I slept great. I have since been pushing it to all of my friends. Oh, and as an added benefit I am seeing a change in my body too!
6020	97	6981	Tiffany from Ojai, CA	2007-04-30 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I am so glad I found your site. I am on my second glass of ACV this morning for what looked like was going to be a nasty sinus infection after a severe allergy attack. The last sinus infection I had was two years ago -- ended up on antibiotics. I am now pregnant and absolutley did not want to go that route. I googled natural remedy for sinus infection as soon as I realized what was happening. Drank my first mixture of ACV yesterday - my fever broke overnight and I felt some relief. Now on my second glass of the day and am feeling so much relief. I actually am liking the taste now, maybe because I can tell how well its working. Thanks!
6022	97	6983	Ron from Sacramento, CA	2007-04-23 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Well, I never made the connection between milk/ice cream or other dairy products but I can tell you this: For over a DECADE I have sufferd from severe throat lesions and sinus problems. I have had culutres,blood work, been on antibiotics countless times. This week I have been very sick. I went back to the "doctor" on Friday and was prescribed Levaquin. After reading how this med could literally kill me and ruin my life I prayed and went searching the internet. I could hardly bare the thought of drinking ACV with my head hurting and my throat as irritated as it was. But, after years of pain I figured anything was worth a try. This morning @ 10am I drank 1/4 cup of ACV in Water. I mean I slammed it. It burned a little but not too bad. I went and laid down and within the hour had some sinus relief for the first time. I took another 1/4 cup dose in water at about 1pm and fell asleep until 3 (I never have been able to sleep during the day). I feel WAY better, still a bit sleepy, but sinuses are almost miraculously better! Thank you so much for this site and this information. I will check back in a few days.
6023	97	6984	Mia from Boston, MA	2007-04-19 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Some like it hot!! I just finished a course of antibiotics for bronchitis and less than a week later got a sinus infection. I was miserable and didn't want to take another course of antibiotics because I'm pregnant and didn't like the idea of being on them in the first place. I spent the first night tossing and turning, miserable from the pressure in my face, the pinchy/stabbing around my eyes, and running to the bathroom to blow my nose. The following day I looked up natural remedies and came across this site. I've heard of ACV's therapeutic qualities, but this was the first time I heard of this. Since I've prepared this as a tea before I immediately boiled some chamomile tea, dropped 2 Tbs in a 16 oz. mug, added honey and lemon and drank it down. Within minutes I could breathe, and within the hour my sinuses felt so much better that I actually felt like I was going to be okay again. I did it again before bed and slept through the night! This is my thrid day and no pain, drip, or pressure! So to all those that can't stand the tast but want the therapy, try it hot!
6024	97	6985	Julie from Newcastle, CA	2007-04-17 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I had the classic pain and pressure in my sinus area (pain in my teeth and around my cheekbones). I leave for Disneyland in 2 days, and I can't spend that time at the doctor's office! I had already tried sudafed to no avail. Like everyone, I googled Sinus Pain Remedy and found this website. It took about an hour for me to notice a difference after drinking some ACV and water (I did 1/4 cup in 8 oz water). I used Heinz ACV because I had it on hand. I repeated it twice yesterday (finally adding some honey because the taste IS pretty bad). This morning, I have no more pain, and just a little pressure left. THANK YOU!

Found your website and read about acv for sinus and yeast. Not willing to go back on meds that caused this nasty thing I started on 2 tbsp organic acv and 1/4 tsp baking soda as internal and straight acv for external cleansing of blistered area .Did this 3 to 4 times daily. It burned for a few seconds but then all itching and burning stopped .In 4 days the blistering and irritation were gone and have not returned. Am still using acv to finish curing this sinus infection and other diabetes related problems also noticed better & easier digestion.Thanks for a great batch of info Highly recommend this site to all.

I just moved into a house where myself and my roomate have had to clean from the former tenents. Not only to mention that I live in the desert where we have had gusts up to 60 mph! The dirt caked on my window is gross! I am also fighting candida. So when I got this last infection it came on STRONG and HARD!The left side of my face felt like someone had pierced me with knitting needles (ouch). I also had the fake flu symptoms (achy and feverish, headache). I looked up "sinus infection natural cures" and found you guys! So this morning I drove to the store bought some apple cider vinegar and mixed 8 oz w/100% cranberry juice and noticed a differance right away! 20 min after taking it my mucas was clear and runnier. It had been thick and green (gross). Praise God! It has been about 4 hours and the left side of my face even feels better! I just took my 2nd cup and will probebly keep using it on a daily basis. Thank You!!!
6028	97	6970	Darian from Springfield, Missouri	2007-04-08 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	About 5 weeks ago, I started having some pretty severe tooth pain in my left upper mouth. Less than a week after it started, the pain moved further and further up into my temples, cheek and eyes. I was able to treat the pain with just ibuprofen at first, however, by the end of the first week, it wasn't enough. For the rest of the period, my day started the same... 3 ibuprofen, 2 tylenol and 2 naproxin sodium tablets everyday. Then I had to add decongestants, allergy meds, and my usual daily multivitamin. On week 3, I went to the doctor. She told me it was a sinus infection, and put me on round one of antibiotics. No luck. On week 4, she put me on another antibiotic. Helped a bit, but I was still getting intense headaches of an evening in my left temple, cheek and behind the eye.
6029	97	6988	Siah from Silver City, New Mexico	2007-04-08 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I am currently 9 months pregnant and finished a course of antibiotics for a sinus infection about 1 week ago, only to develop a yeast infection because of the antibiotics. I felt good for 1 day after finishing the antibiotics and then symptoms returned. I did not want to take another course of antibiotics and risk getting another yeast infection so close to delivery so I got on the internet to look for a natural cure and came across the apple cider vinegar remedy. I went directly to the health food store and bought some organic apple cider vinegar and drank 1/4 cup mixed with 16 ounces of organic apple juice. I didn't notice anything, but later tried the steam (1/4 cup apple cider vinegar and 1/4 cup water). My sinuses finally began to drain. I have continued drinking the mixture and breathing in the steam for 3 days and feel almost 100% better. I can breathe easily now, but I still have some crud down my throat when I first wake up in the morning. I am sold on this remedy and am so grateful I came across this website so I didn't have to get on more antibiotics. I actually felt relief faster from the apple cider vinegar than I did from the previous course of antibiotics. Interestingly, I had just eaten a Dairy Queen ice cream cone the day before my symptoms returned.
6031	97	6990	Brian from Gainesville, VA	2007-04-02 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	It has been two months since I started trying the apple cider vinegar for my sinuses and I cannot deny any longer the positive effects. I didn't see much of anything for the first week and a half or so, but then I could feel the pressure start to ease slightly. By a month in, I could sleep on my back for the first time in years (I've had to sleep on my side to avoid sinus headaches in the morning). My wife, who made fun of me at first for trying this now freely admits to me and to our friends that I don't snore as much anymore. We are both pretty surprised. I just take two spoonfuls in my bottled water each morning and one spoon in my herb tea. Many thanks - I am so glad I happened to google your site up!
6032	97	6991	Lanna from Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada	2007-03-29 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	ACV helping a sinus infection: Just when I thought I had tried everything, along came your website. I have had a sinus infection on and off for the last 6 months. They have plagued me for 20 plus years. In December I took a full course (3 weeks) of Biaxin and thought it was gone...Surprise! It wasn't. January comes and we go to England for a holiday. Once again it rears it's ugly head and I am put on Cipro, while over there, and continue (once home) with more of the same from my own Doctor. Within a month I am back to the same old symptoms once again. Needless to say I am fed up with drugs that don't work, and Doctors that have no answers for me. I should mention that I have also tried Grapefruit seed extract irrigation, Salt water irrigation, as well as Colloidal Silver. Yes...each of these remedies is as fun as it sounds! Fast forward to Thursday March 22. I type in "cure a sinus infection without antibiotics" and up pops this web site. Today is March 29, and as they say, the rest is history. I did the drink and the steaming and I am feeling well on my road to "normalness"!!! No more discolored stuff, no more post nasel drip and best of all I have energy again! Cannot thank you enough for what a great solution to for an illness that is rapidly becoming an epidemic in our modern world.

I had a sinus infection going on three weeks still had headache and stuffed up. I drank 1/4 c acv straight and with 1-2 hrs felt better. I also tried 1c acv & 1 c water bring to boil and inhale steam, my nose started running within 5 min. I told my mother and she stated she, my father and also sister have used acv previously. Also my grandmother said she used to drink it and my mother thought she was nuts. It does work try it you will see.

It never really stopped me from eating it - I just "knew" it. But I'm not a big milk product consumer anyway. A slice of cheese here and there. A little cream in my coffee. But my weakness is ice cream. Generally - I prefer a single brand "Breyers" that I can't recall having problems with, but occassionally - I'll take my daughter out for a treat somewhere. One day we were out and stopped for lunch - on a whim, I got a milk-shake. A rare treat for me. Inside of 24 hours - I started to feel sick. My husband - an EMT (a PURE organic eater and non-milk drinker), swore I had the flu. But it never *felt* like the flu to me. About 24 hours into the "flu" I started looking up info about ACV - something I'd researched before after suffereing a horrible bout of food poisoning a year earlier. I found this site and originally discounted what it had to say. *I* hadn't eaten any ice cream! Then I REALLY thought about what I'd been eating - and yep, I remembered the milk shake. AH... I started right in on the ACV and within 24 hours felt better. Yep - it was truly an allergic reation I was having. I've gotten several friends (who were suffereing with sinus problems for weeks) to try the ACV as well and they ALL report great improvement. I've stayed away from commercial ice cream since then (but I still get my milk in my coffee) and I can report a clear sinus passage with nary an infection again. I learned my lesson! And I keep a supply of ACV at ALL times.

6036	97	6995	Lynn from Danby, VT	2007-03-19 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	The Mayo Clinic came out with a report some time ago that all sinus infections are caused by yeast overgrowth. That's why ACV is working for alot of you. I am now doing ACV as well as FiveLac. Love this website!
6037	97	6996	Karen from Consecon, Ontario	2007-03-15 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have been suffering from sinusitis on & off for 4 months now which flared up again this week. I can't see my doctor for 2 weeks & a wait at the hospital can be anywhere from 3 - 9 hours. So I thought I would check the net & found this site. I was amazed at the wealth of information I found here on my problem (I believe now I also have Candida which causes the sinus infection). This particular flare up started about 23 hours after eating ice cream but I thought it was something I picked up when my family was here & they weren't feeling well. I went straight to town to get some ACV & when I got home & tried it I was amazed at the immediate result! Within 10 minutes I could feel my sinuses starting to drain! This morning was my third round of it & I actually found a way to drink it that tasted good. I used 2 tbsp of ACV, 1/4 tsp baking soda, 1/2 cup apple juice & 1/4 cup water. I forgot the honey but it tasted good. The only question I have is, is the honey important or just for taste?

I couldn't sleep at night because I was so stuffed up and my throat was unbelievably sore I tried the acv it was horrible but i do feel better I also tried the coconut oil. Not sure which one worked or if a combination but will keep using it until this is gone.
6051	97	7008	Frank from DFW, TX	2006-12-08 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	PLEASE READ ALL OF THIS POST! I have had sinus problems all my life. I go to the Doctor at least 3 times a yr. Last Feb. I got a sinus infection, took the meds the Doc gave, 15 days after I ran out of meds the infection was coming back. I have been to the Doc 5 times this year, can't get rid of the infection! After reading this, I tried it on 12/06/06 just drinking it. the next morning I was clear as a bell and amazed. This infection I had was going into my eyes and ears as well, it has to be one of the worst I've had. Today is 12/08/06, in two days I feel 90% better. I have one Q. how many days should I drink this, or how many days can I drink it? Sorry, 3 Q. if I drink it alot, is there any harm it will do? Last Q. once I am clear, will the infection come back? or does the ACV kill the infection? I am almost afraid to stop drinking it,,lol,,it works that good! I mixed ACV with cranberry apple juice and a little cranberry grape juice, it taste kinda like wine. Thank you people for all that you do.
6039	97	6998	Jodi from Redmond, Oregon	2007-03-11 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	On Wednesday, March 7th, I woke up with a maxillary sinus infection, after fighting a cold for about a week and a half. I called my doctor to request antibiotics, but before he had a chance to call me back, I got online to research some natural cures. I came upon your site, and decided I had nothing to lose. I took my first dose of ACV, 1/4 cup (which I mixed with about 1 cup of White Grape Raspberry juice), around 3:00 pm. Ten minutes later, I was breathing for the first time in ten days and I could feel the pressure under my cheek bones and the pain in my tooth (common with maxillary sinus infections) dissipating! I thought it must have been a fluke. I started feeling a little more pressure coming on later in the evening, so I took another dose at 8:00 pm. I woke up Thursday morning totally clear, and the sinus infection was GONE!!! I took three doses on Thursday "just incase" and one dose Friday (also "just incase"). The ACV was definitely not the best thing I'd ever tasted. It was MUCH worse when I mixed it with more juice. After the first dose, I found mixing the ACV with an equal amount of juice (1/4 cup juice, 1/4 cup ACV) was much easier to take. Plug your nose, drink it down, and chase it with plain juice. I have already recommended this to a dozen people and I've only known about it for five days!
6040	97	6999	Matt from Springfield , VA	2007-03-07 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Yes the ACV does work to get the mucous moving and draining again. I usually do the ACV, and Vitamin C from Garden of Life, and the biggest help I've found so far has been a Nasal Irrigator (google it), since I started using the irrigator I no longer need to get antibiotics in which I was almost living off of previously. Also when having a sinus infection NO - MILK, SUGAR OR BREAD.

Really bad headache, pressure around the sinuses and eyes, and constant runny nose. Clear liquid. I saw your information about drinking 1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar with 8 oz. water and started it around 3 pm. I was actually able to breathe, cough less and slept last night! I feel so much better today! It totally worked for me.

I woke up this morning feeling better then i've felt in a long time. (1)all the inflammation in my sinuses and chest is gone, including my back and neck (I had a triple disk neck fusion 3 years ago and have issues with swelling still(2)I could feel my sinus's draining, which usually took about 3 days of heavy antibiotics, but this morning was a miracle(3)I have more energy then usual (4)I can breath better because my chest is clear(5)I feel like a new person today. Thank you for this site! I have been emailing all my friends and telling them about ACV and the effects. (I also had a severe yeast infection, which is clearing up also! just in case you gals wanted to know! I will update again tomorrow morning.
6044	97	7002	Anne from Tahuya, WA	2007-02-16 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	February 16th: OK, this will sound obscure but but I was desperate. I started out searching the web for yeast infection cures and found that drinking ACV 3X a day could cure it for most of us gals. I then decided to look up ACV on the web to see what other things it cured (it seemed to be one of the ingredients in yeast & sinus infection remedies): I found this site and was amazed at what I've read. In the mean time i've already drank a good dose of ACV for the yeast problem, but also have a sever sinus infection, and 10 minutes after drinking it I can feel everything stirring up! Faster then antibiotics. If this cures both issues, then I will drink it all the time. I will update again in a couple days and let you all know! I love this site and what i've read from everyone.
6045	97	6836	Teressa from Naples, FL	2007-02-01 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	This past week I did develop a sinus infection- the constant headache, pain in the nose area, and just couldn't breath, so I couldn't sleep. I had planned to visit the doctor, but found this website first. I have ACV at home, so that nite, a couple days ago, I drank a glass of water with at least one oz. of ACV in it. In 1 hour, my headache was gone and I could breath again, and slept great! I sniffed the ACV the next day and drank more of it, I don't think it taste bad, actually. I am completely cured of a painful sinus infection!!
6046	97	7003	Jenell from Dallas, TX	2007-01-13 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I was sick for several days...had taken different OTC drugs, all the while drinking tons and tons of water, my sinuses were causing more and more problems. I was having major headaches from all the pressure, and I decided I was going to go get the ACV. I actually almost decided against going because I felt so bad, but I went. As soon as I came home I drank almost an ounce of it mixed with tea...at that time I had no sense of taste or smell, so it wasn't bad(just to add...I haven't been able to taste or smell for 4 or 5 days now), I started to notice within 30 minutes to an hour that I wasn't feeling so congested anymore, and the pressure on my sinus cavity was decreasing..I drank another 3/4 ounce ACV mixed with a glass of apple juice about 2 1/2 hours later..I went to bed feeling much better than I had felt just prior to taking the ACV. I woke up today and felt pretty good, but I decided I should probably drink it for the next couple of days, And when I drank it I realized I could taste and smell again!! Ewww, it tastes bad....but I'm SOOOO glad I can smell and taste again!! Thanks!!!
6047	97	7004	Dan from Brownstown, MI	2007-01-05 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Last February, I had a horrible sinus infection for about five days that would not go away. My head hurt so bad every minute of the day and I suffered through endless pounding head-aches and sinus-aches. I couldn't breathe and had trouble sleeping every night. I tried NyQuill, Thera-Flu, and just about every other over the counter relief but nothing worked. I was between jobs and didn't have any health insurance so I couldn't afford the advice of a doctor. I visited this website, found the apple cider vinegar remedy. In my utter desperation I was willing to try anything no matter how bad it may have tasted.
6048	97	7005	Shawn from San Diego, CA	2007-01-01 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have been fighting a sinus infection for probably 1 month and did not know it. I would get sick for a couple of weeks then feel a little better. I took 1 dose today of the Cider and both nasal passages have cleared a lot, but still have some mucus. I stopped taking my meds that the doctor had given me. Should I continue talking the meds?
6049	97	7006	Mandy from Avon OH	2006-12-30 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	This stuff is amazing. I mixed 1/4 cup of ACV with water and used fruit punch as a chaser. It has only been 10 minutes and I feel better. The pressure is almost gone and I can breathe again. Thank you so much. I hate taking medicine so any natural cure I can find that works is amazing.
6052	97	7009	Melinda from Sutherlin, VA	2006-11-14 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I came upon your site while in a desperate attempt to rid myself of an awful sinus infection. I do think that it came from the consumption of ice cream. I had several days of flu like symptoms prior to the sinus infection. I started taking antibiotics on the 10th and did not find any major relief until yesterday morning after drinking 16 oz of white grape juice mixed with 1/8th cup of ACV. I actually had a bit of drainage within minutes of using this formula. I am sipping it today with water. I feel so much better and actually have lots of energy and am enjoying my 3 kids again! I am thankful for your site, as my 2 month old daughter is recovering from open heart surgery and I was concerned about having to call the doctor for more antibiotics and having to see a doctor right now is almost impossible since she is to stay indoors and away from people. She is also fully breast fed and this recipe has not hindered my milk or the taste of it. What a true blessing. Mama of 3
6053	97	7010	Terri from Eustis, FL	2006-11-09 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	ACV worked on my sinus infection although I do not find it palatable in the least. I diluted it in water and still found it to be repulsive : ) but for curing a sinus infection, five stars! However, BEWARE, my 17 year old daughter had been suffering from a sinus infection also and she took it, she ended up in the doctors office much sicker than she already was, she has asthma and apparently ACV is very harmful for asthma sufferers. Hope this article helps!
6054	97	7011	Kate from NY, NY	2006-11-04 00:00:00	NAY	1	0	Be careful about self diagnosing your sinus infections. I was taking ACV for them and was just feeling worse and worse. I went to see a nutritionist and it turns out the sinus problems were actually a symptom of virus, parasites and candida. And ACV is probably the worst thing I could have been taking. These ailments cause other kinds of reactions that mock sinus infection. See a doctor before taking anything.

I can't afford to go to the doctors so I decided to check to see if there is anything I can do for it. I am so happy that I found this site thank you so much. I am already feeling alot better and can actually stand up without feeling as if my head is going to explode. Bad thing for me now my husband well expect me to get the house more picked up. LOL Thank you again what a life saver.
6056	97	7013	Liza from Ft. Worth, TX	2006-10-14 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I read about the ACV remedy to cure a sinus infection and I must admit that at first I didn't believe it. I was desperate to try anything because I never had a sinus infection before and I couldn't stand the pain. My husband had a sinus infection for more than a week and nothing he took worked. So I tried the ACV remedy and I was very impressed and relieved. It tasted awful but it worked in less than 15 minutes.. my sore throat, phlegm, sinus pressure and headache were gone. I woke up the next morning feeling great. I'm so glad I tried it, otherwise I would of been suffering with the pain for a long time. I called everyone I know and recommend them to try it the next time they get a sinus infection. Thanks!

I tried both the tomato tea and the apple cider vinegar for 5 days in a row. No luck for me. Still can't smell, taste or hear after 3 weeks.
6058	97	7015	Christina from Audubon, PA	2006-09-26 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Like most readers I came to this website in pure desperation. I once again got a sinus infection the first time the weather temp changed. Looking for an alternative to Tylenol Cold, etc. I was a bit skeptical about the ACV method. I tried to drink it 1/2 and 1/2 with water as quickly as possible, but had to do it much slower to get used to the flavor (this was yesterday). Today I've been drinking it all day even more diluted with 2 tbls of honey which helped tremendously. I have to say I am shocked, relieved, and in disbelief! This stuff REALLY WORKS!!! My husband can't get over it either. I am not 100% better, but what would normally go on for 2 weeks and then I'd catch another cold/sinus infection etc, has cleared up in less than 2 days! I am hooked for life. I am sharing this website with all my friends and family. Thank you so much!!
6059	97	7016	Ellen from South Carolina	2006-09-26 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have been suffering from severe periodic bouts of sinus infections for around 4 years. I usually wind up on antibiotics which includes a trip to my dentist thinking I may have an abscess tooth. The pain around my cheekbones and upper teeth with facial swelling is pretty much unbearable. I just finished 2 weeks worth of biaxin to absolutely no avail. As a last resort before decapitating myself, I checked the internet for a possible home remedy. I found the apple cider vinegar remedy and boy is it ever a miracle. I wasn't able to drink it, but I mixed half equal portions of vinegar and water, brought it to a boil and inhaled the fumes covering my face with a towel. In less than 24 hours I am completely well. I really still can't believe this works. I plan on keeping ACV on hand at all times. I am sharing this with every sinus sufferer I know. Thanks for this great tip!

I live in Florida and have been told by an allergist that I have numerous allergies (according to his tests). I have take antibiotics, nasal sprays, over the counter and prescription drugs to combat my sinus issues which have continued to make me miserable. Recently I developed yet another sinus infection, painful, stuffy head, difficulty breathing, etc. In desperation I began searching for natural cures. Thanks to your site and article on ACV, in just 3 short days I feel miraculously normal. Thank you God for your wonderful people that care enough to post this site. I also have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia so I am going to use ACV long term and see if it helps, is so I will post more feedback. Thank you for being there : ) Terri from Florida (age 43)
6061	97	6843	Jacalyn from Round Rock, TX	2006-09-10 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	i had lived with what i thought was a migraine for four days, on day five--my sinuses were rock hard. i thought i would go to urgent care, but decided to go online to see if there were any natural cures. i tried the 1/2 cup acv and 1/2 cup water; and also the acv steaming and i put colloidal silver in my nasal spray. the nasal spray and the acv steam made my sinuses burn for 45 minutes--but about an hour later--i got relief. i decided to do the cure 3 times today. here i sit 9 hours later--yet to do my last treatment--and i feel absolutely normal. my husband just said--"hey, where's your ice pack?" I've had one on my head, face and neck for five days! I am so thankful for this website and I encourage anyone with a sinus problem to give this a try. Just drinking the acv mixture didn't do the trick for me--but using the acv steam and nasal treatment with the acv drink surely has proven to be the answer for me. thanks!
6740	111	7626	Maria from Orlando, FL	2006-05-11 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Worked like Magic! I started gargling when I felt I was getting my daughter's virus. She had a severely sore throat and couldn't swallow for a few days. It took about 24 hours to clear it, but I immediately felt true relief after gargling for about a minute. I repeated a few times during the day. Now I know what to do in the future!
6062	97	7017	David from Waynesboro, PA	2006-09-03 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Ok, I absolutely HATE the taste or even smell of vinegar so I was very reluctant to try this remedy, but I was desperate. I read that even the fumes of the ACV helped so I started out by sniffing it. No joke, within a few minutes I started to feel my sinuses drain; mucus became much thinner. It didn't smell too strong, so I decided to drink it. I mixed 1/3 cup ACV with 6 oz. of green tea with Ginseng & honey. It burns a little going down, but not all that bad once you get used to it. I feel SO MUCH BETTER already and it's only been about 10 minutes. I am so glad I found this site! Not sure if this will cure it, but at least it'll give me relief until I get antibiotics.

I had a sinus infection and with previous history I've always went to the doctor. With no insurance this gets expensive. They always say antibiotic use is not good. I wanted a home remedy. I have to say the acv WORKED! Right after using it I felt better. I've repeated this throughout the day and feel I'm almost over it. Without a doctor.
6064	97	7019	Skip from Jackson,Alabama	2006-06-09 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I am an insurance adjuster, and as you may guess, a large portion of my last year has been spent in New Orleans, LA due to the hurricane and flood damages. Mold is an under statement. It seems that every time I would go into N.O. I would return with a chronic sinus infection. I would go to the Dr. and be prescribed antibiotics. This began to worry me that I may become immune and one day really need them and they not be effective. I found this site and tried the vinegar, but instead of drinking it or warming it and inhaling the vapors,I used a nebulizer , used straight vinegar and to my surprise my sinus infection cleared within 2-3 days. Even faster than the antibiotics. Thanks for sharing this info. I just wish I would have found it sooner.
6065	97	7020	David from Queen Creek, AZ	2006-05-25 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I've been getting sinus infections once or twice a year for the last 10 years and they would last between 4 and 6 months, this last infection has lasted 1 1/2 years, went to the doctor twice, each time I got antibiotics, even the Doctor had doubts that it would clear up, he talked about doing surgery, I didn't want that, so for the past 9 months I've getting by with over the counter drugs and sinus rinses, then I came across this website just last Friday, bought a bottle of ACV at the local food market, Monday the 21st I drank 4oz of ACV with 4oz of water, I realize that I didn't dilute it enough, the taste was really bad and my stomach was badly upset, the rest of the day I notice that I no longer was spitting out green/yellow mucus, it was clear and no headache. Day 4, repeated just one 4oz drink(with 20oz of water) for each day and I can honestly say that the infection is gone.

6068	97	7022	Ed from North Wales, PA	2006-04-26 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I am a 44 yr old male that has been getting sinus infections 3 or 4 times a year for the last 17 years or so. I am in otherwise great shape, going to the gym 4/5 times a week and running up to 25 miles a week. However, I was never able to kick these infections. My body has built up a resistance to antibiotics over the years. I now must take strong antibiotics like avelox to get rid of the infections. I dreaded getting my next sinus infection because I couldn't workout and because I knew I was hurting my body with the antibiotics Well the other shoe dropped again and I got another infection this past week. My last one was over christmas holidays. Once I get them, I cannot get rid of them and its off to the doctor . My symptoms are: it usually begins as a sore throat, muscle aches, sinus pressure, swollen and sore lymph nodes in neck, slight fever and of coarse thick green/yellow mucus. I decided to do a search on sinus infections and found this site. I am by nature a skeptical person so I figured I would eventually be going to the doctor soon enough. I read the article and went out to the Whole Foods store and bought _______s ACV. Started it friday night with a higher dose than what they said, 1 oz ACV and 7 oz distilled water. Woke up breathing through my mouth and a stuffed up nose, not much change. Chilled most of the day, and took 4 more doses, early morning , noon, late afternoon and before bed. I woke up Sunday morning and my nose was not stuffed up. It is now sunday afternoon and mucus is just about gone, and I'm feeling much better than earlier in the week. I plan on continuing my mixture for a couple more days and then go to a lower dose to keep them away. I am quite pleased that maybe I can stay away from the doctors and the drugs now. thanks for posting the info.

I had almost instant results and over the last few days my head has cleared up significantly so many thanks for the tip.

I gave him a mix of 1ml ACV and 4ml water in an oral syringe, and by the next day his mucus had lessened immensely and had turned from yellow to clear, and stayed that way all day. Thanks!
6071	97	7025	Scott from Alpharetta, Georgia	2006-03-11 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have suffered from Sinus and ear infections for the last 3 years. The last period began Dec 24/2005. Since that time I have been on 7 weeks of Antibiotics, plus 300 MG of Suphedrine and 400 -800 MG of Ibuprofen daily. I gave up on the antibiotics Feb 19, but continued with Suphedrine and Ibuprofen until March 10. I began breathing over pot of hot water mixed with vicks and nasal rinse with saline around Feb. 1 2006. The pot/towel and nasal rinse alleviated some of the pressure and I would get some drainage, yellow/green thick mucus, but no improvement. On the morning of march 10 I was fed up. I went online to look for a cure using

Reading everybody's feedback I decided to give it a try, I mixed 1/4 cup with 16oz of water and drank it down and to my surprise 30 mins later the heaviness in my chest was gone and my mucus was draining really well also my nose cleared up right away! This still is amazing. I am so glad I found this site. I will be taking ACV daily now to keep up my heath. I LOVE IT!!!! Thanks again.

My Doctor has given me several things over the years to help w/ almost chronic sinus problems. Some things have worked, but only for a short time. Today, I bought some All Natural Apple Cider Vinegar. I poured an unspecified amount in a bottle of Aquafina and took a sip... Right there in store's the parking lot. I was amazed that within 10 seconds or so of my first two sips, I could actually breathe through both nostrils for the first time in 3 days. I was utterly amazed. Thank you whoever figured this one out... You are my hero.

6079	97	7033	Maureen from Monroe, MI	2005-12-29 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have had chronic problems with sinus infections for the past couple of years. I recently got another infection and decided to look online for remedies instead of run to the doctor again - traditional medicine doesn't always help anyway and is costly. I already had a bad full blown sinus infection going when I found this website and read about ACV. I called a local health food store to find organic ACV and went and got some right away. I took my first dose of ACV before going to bed last night. I was in AWFUL shape when I went to bed, but was a little better when I got up this morning. I have rested today and taken 3 more doses of the ACV tonic today. It is now 24 hours since I took the first dose and I have to say that right now I am remarkably better than I was last night. I am not completely better yet, but very much better than I was yesterday. These sinus infections usually hit me hard and make me miserable for several days. I am at least functional and feel like I am improving all the time instead of getting worse like I usually do when I get this. So... I guess I am saying that at least in my case, it helped a lot to do this even after I already had it bad, but I plan to continue with the tonic indefinitely 1-3x a day to see if it helps prevent future infections. I have learned a lot from this site and plan to keep visiting the site. I read the warning about how the acid can harm your teeth. I have been putting 1/2 tsp of baking soda in a 6-8 oz glass of water to use as a mouth rinse right after I drink my tonic so as to neutralize the acid in my mouth and prevent problems with my teeth. I will let you know if that seems to prevent any problems. Thanks again. I am feeling better.

I now realize that I may have a sinus infection from a recent cold I had. I've been taking the apple cider vinegar regiment for two plus days now and I've noticed at least two things: higher energy, and better complexion. My sinus problem is putting up a fight, but I have a good feeling about this cure. I hope it works.
6081	97	7035	Yolanda from Grass Valley, CA	2005-11-29 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I am a believer! I had a sinus infection, did a search online in hopes of finding a cure w/out a prescription, found this site by chance,and tried a few things. I started with the apple cider vinegar (_______'s) and it helped, but the miracle happened when I bought oil of oregano capsules. Two days later, I could breathe at night and my mucus was well on it's way to clearing up. I continued for a couple more days after that and I am cured. In the meantime, I have been drinking the ACV in the morning to help clear me up (I think it is allergies at this point) and it works great. I also suffer from migraines and I am excited to hear this will help. One thing I tried that worked OK but didn't make much difference for me was the tomato drink for congestion. I am not giving up on it though because it has lots of garlic and vitamin C. I am grateful to this website! Thanks!

6084	97	7038	Karen from St. Louis	2005-07-29 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I am normally sceptical, but yesterday I was also desperate. My sinuses hurt badly yesterday. At lunch time I went and got the store brand of Apple Cider Vinegar and spring water. I thought "what could it hurt." My sinuses felt like I would never recover. I took a dose of the ACV with 8 ounces of water and immdeiately, the congestion in my throat started to break up. By the middle of the day (and my second dose), my headache had mostly dissapated.I took the third dose before bed along with some sinus meds. Today: No Headache! My sinuses are still blocked some, but I was well on my way to a doozy of a sinus infection when I tried this, so even though the ACV did not cure me overnight, it did enough for me to continue taking "the cure" until my sinus infection is gone (hopefully by tomorrow). I can not believe the difference btween today and yesterday!!

I have tried prescription medicine, the recommended tomato juice, oregano oil and acv. The pressure in my head (sinus area) is not getting less and on top, since I have been taken Apple Cider Vinegar (2 ts on 16oz over the day) for about a week I have a "crawling" headache up the back of my head. Any recommendations?
6086	97	7040	Gary from Kulpmont, Pa	2009-11-01 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	sinus infections: I find acv & honey help a lot.I use only acv with the "mother" in it and raw honey if you can get it. I saw a doctor on tv yrs ago who said he found out that it was a fungus that lies deep in the back of the head, which is dormant most of the time. I use olive leaf extract which is anti-fungul and I also use olive leaf nose spray plus a neti pot. Ask your DR. for anti-fungul medicine. Olive leaf kills many viruses and bad bacteria and fungae. Use according to directions on olive leaf products. I use 1 tbls acv & 1 tbls honey.

She was coughing a lot and blowing her nose. I was exposed to this for about 3 days. Two days after I finished the job I was working in the garden and had an overwhelming sinus attack. I thought it was spring allergies and treated it as that. It did not abate. As I continued working at a different job sight, I got worse and the sinus infection turned green! Then I got larengytis.
6122	98	7074	Rodney J from Kaysville, Utah	2007-03-12 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Rod here again. Here is one that is really amazing! If you have a sinus irrigation system like the Grosann system, to 500 ml of saline solution, add 1 tsp of h202 to the mix and run in through your sinus. It is somewhat uncomfortable if you have a bad sinus infection, but the end results are incredible! I do this when I get a bad cold and it usually cuts 2 days off the duration off the cold.

I still feel flu like symptoms (achy with slight temp, headache, dry cough especially when lying down to sleep, earache with weird numbness around left ear with echoing only in one ear now), exacerbated at night time in particular. I have reduced pnasal drip (green mucus) and sore throat since doing Apple Cider Vinegar drops in water and sinus rinsing, as well as cayenne mixture (1tsp) with honey (1tbs) and Apple Cider Vinegar (1tbs).

Going to the doctor tomorrow to get some real medication.
6090	97	7044	Asheley from Smyrna, Georgia	2010-12-27 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Well, I was skeptical about this at first. I have used cayenne to gargle with for a sore throat and thought it would be hell to put up your nose, but that crap works wonders! I mixed a cup of filtered water, lukewarm, with a neti pot packet, 5 drops of ACV, and a tiny dash of cayenne (the tail end of the tip of a knife). It made me have to blow my nose for about 5 minutes straight, but an hr and a half later, I am clear as a bell. A sinus infection set in 2 days ago and yesterday I started oil of oregano pills and nasal spray with grapefruit seed extract. I felt better when I got up today, but the cayenne/ACV rinse has really done the trick. Thanks Earth Clinic.

After reading everything you had on Sinus treatments I made my own. My two children (at the time 2 and 5) had awful sinus stuff... On allergy medicines and nose sprays that made their noses bleed. They had inherited my bad sinuses and were never without a stuffed up nose or ear infection. I tried the ACV drink and it did help, but there was no way I was getting a 1 year old and a 4 year old to drink ACV!
6092	97	7046	Bradshad from North Providence, Rhode Island	2012-07-01 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Yes I have used Apple Cider Vinegar in the neti pot, and I got the suggestion off earth clinic. I used 1 teaspoon in luke warm water. You may want to use less the first few times because it does burn a little. I use it when I am really clogged or have a sinus infection. It draws quite well. Also if you looking to kill a sinus infection off try cutting up a little garlic in the neti pot and leave it for awhile or a small amount of cayenne powder. I have killed of sinus infections this way. I dont know the long term side effects so I only use these remedies occasionally. Good luck.

Or what I believed was a sinus infection cause I did not go to a doctor.... I had a lump that I first felt inside of my nose about a week ago... Then I was able to feel the lump on the outside of my nose and I got worried. I was told by a friend it could be a sinus infection. So I looked for a natural cure and came across this website... I did the ACV.... Wonderful!!! With the honey added for 3 days.... Also got the neti pot!!! I will tell you after the first use the lump inside my nose was gone!! After two uses I was lump free!! I do no that it has something to do with pollen, dust, pets, and other things... All which are in my life... My job is so dusty its crazy... I have made the neti pot a part of my life now!! Thank you to all of you!!
6094	97	7048	Bruce  from Huntington Beach, Ca, Usa	2010-01-10 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have gotten a lot of great information from Earthclinic, so now it's time for me to share my experiences: I had a sinus infection that began zfter a cold, that lasted for a full year. I decided to put apple cider vinegar into my sinus rinse "pot", along with 1/2 cup spring water, 1/2 tsp sea salt and 1/2 tsp baking soda. The first time I tried this, I used way too much acv (est 1-1/2 tbl). I bravely pored the mixture in both nostrils - hurt a LOT and the mucus began to flow freely. I was up and down all night, carefully blowing my nose, but the next day ohhh what uncongested nasal passages! Susequent irrigations weren't as painful, now that the infection has cleared up, but I rinse once daily anyway to clear out the remains of the infection. See in another post my experiences with cinnamon/clove/thyme oils.

6096	98	7050	Dolly from Melbourne, Vic, AU	2007-03-22 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I went to the doctors re severe sinusitis becoming a bronchitis infection 3 weeks ago and got a cocktail of antibiotics. Recently got results of blood tests which showed I had a virus which of course antibiotics don't treat, doctor had nothing to give me for it. Don't know if it was the virus symptoms plus after effects of penicillin antibiotics. Last night my gland engorgement and bloating in stomach and pain in upper abdomen, swelling in neck and kidney with pain, had got severe I looked like I was in advanced pregnancy! There was another episode where my face and neck swelled in the night. Out of frustration and desperation to find a cure found this web site, (and because I didn't have any ACV, drank some red wine vinegar in water, and periodically cleaned my sinus's with FESS sinu-cleanse can, (contains salt). This morning everything is nearly back to normal. Is it possible that the properties in ACV are the same in all vinegars? My stomach bloating has gone down, sinusitis relieved, kidney pain usually intense in morning down) throat glands are no longer strangling me.
6097	98	7051	Logan from Montreal, Quebec, Canada	2009-02-16 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I always make tea with a japanese/chinese mushroom called reishi (ling zhi in chinese - it is the best for boosting the immune system) and I had been chewing on a few cloves of garlic (this really helped, but only temporarily) but this wasn't cutting it alone for this sinus infection I had. So after checking this site, I decided to do a combo of many of the ideas. I added cayenne pepper to the tea. I also got some wild oregano oil which I both consumed and I inhaled the steam. Basically for 2 days I constantly chewed raw garlic, inhaled steam from the tea, drank the tea, repeat. This is the third day and I now feel almost back to normal... I feel no pressure and no blockage in my nose or allergy irritations, just a very slight drip. My sinus infection had started 3 weeks ago, and before this weekend it was actually getting much much worse.
6135	98	7087	Tish from Granger	2005-12-19 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Please, please, please add this recommendation: gargling with salt water and flushing your nose/sinuses out with salt water helps with sinus/allergy and headaches. Take 1/2 tsp salt and 8oz warm water. Gargle first then you can use a waterpic device from the drugstore, or get a little device like you use to suction out a babies nose. Fill with saltwater and shoot it up the nose. Don't inhale, just relax and let it go though the nasal cavity. This really relieved all my sinus/allergy problems (in addition to using acv.)
6098	98	7052	Avi from London, United Kingdom	2009-01-26 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Thanks so much for the info on Borax, its doing an amazing job on my chronic candida infection. Sinus infection has been a big, BIG, painful problem, causing the kind of headache that occupies everything from the neck up. I recently learned that sniffing up 3% H2O2 can shift that, but I find it really painful and so I tried the advice of a local herb gardener who said to sniff up rhubarb juice, and it worked magnificently. Stings a little bit, but clears out a lot within minutes and keeps working all day, so you might be slightly sniffy, but great relief, and doing it once every day keeps the sinuses clear, although I don't think its a cure, just a great way of expelling toxins. Mixing 50/50 RAW rhubarb juice and colloidal silver [in distilled water] removes the sting but isn't quite as effective as just rhubarb juice. Anyway, variations on that theme give me immediate relief from sinus headaches. This is useful to me when I detox too fast, maybe it can be useful to others.
6099	98	7053	Karen from Alpharetta, Georgia	2008-03-25 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Riboflavin B2 100mg right before bedtime will take care of sinus drainage.It will work in about 20 minutes. If not,try up to 250mg. I had severe sinus drainage for years.I found it hard to sit through meetings,church etc, without coughing my head off. I would eat and have a reaction to food and start coughing uncontrollably.Sometimes medications worked,sometimes not. Sometimes I would double up on medication. Now I take NOTHING!
6100	98	7054	Sue from Sydney, New South Wales, Australia	2012-07-12 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I just want to say that whilst traveling in China, without a neti pot or any kind of nasal spray or lavage equipment and no access to any pharmacy or medical clinic at the time, I successfully used a sterilised travel bottle, normally used as cabin bag 100ml toiletry bottle (like a little squirt bottle), as a make-shift saline rinse bottle.
6101	98	7055	Joanne from Victoria, Bc Canada	2012-06-14 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I had a SEVERE sinus infection with raw throat for 3 weeks and had tried everything except anti-biotics because they have never worked. When I finally went to the doc he said most sinus infections are viral and therefore the drugs don't work. He said if it went longer than 10 days (when I virus has finished running its course) then a person could consider the drugs. I didn't want them. What worked? Three days using sinus rinse system from the pharmacy with their mixture of one part sea salt and one part baking soda added to filtered and BOILED water, which had been cooled, twice a day. I used this plus sprays of GSE, then Xylitol-based and the one the doctor recommended was the capsicum (cayenne) based homeopathic spray. It did help but the final nail in this vicious infections coffin was sinus rinse. Make sure you don't push too hard as I accidentally blew water into my ear canal and could hardly hear for two days. No fun! Anyway, I recommend Neilmed plastic bottle as it works great.. I treated the top with hydrogen peroxide on a tissue and left the bottom and top out to dry. I rinsed morning and night... Good luck and thanks SOO much to Earthclinic for giving us all this space to share such crucial information. Bless you guys!!
6102	98	7056	Lezlie W  from Los Angeles, Ca	2011-10-10 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	The best cure for sinus infection is a nasal saline rinse. I would get sinus infections that made me super sick for two weeks. At one point they kept reappearing every 3 months. I finally got fed up and went on-line for a remedy. I found a reference to this and decided to try it. It worked pretty effectively and quickly. I used The neilmed brand aftvies scoping out all the options on the drug store shelves. I chose it because it seemed simple compared with the other methods. When I used it, it stopped my cold flu symptoms from putting me in that I need to stay in bed and rest all day state. Then I noticed my running nose and stuffy head went away too. I was still able to function daily as the symptoms declined with the use of the saline nasal rinses. Big difference from the way the infections knocked me out ANC made me feel. I'd say after three days of the washes you feel a big difference and after a week of the washes there's no signs of the infection. Since using this twice, once in the midst of a full blown infection and once at the onset, I haven't had a sinus infection since. It's been a year and a half.

I work with toddlers and I thought that it would take me forever to feel 100% again, which is very important when working with young, energetic ones! Dreading the money it would cost to visit a Dr. (as I do not have health care) I decided to try something natural first. Thank goodness for this website! I mixed just a little over 1/4 teaspoon of salt, a pinch of baking soda and a tiny cap-full of hydrogen peroxide in 1 cup of warm water. I used a baby ear/nose bulb and rinsed like there was no tomorrow. A whole mess of green/yellow mucus came right out of my nose and continued to after the treatment every time I blew my nose. Immediately after the all of the gunk came out I could breathe again, pressure was gone and I was happy! I am very grateful for this amazing website!

6106	98	7060	Jason from Fort Lauderdale, FL	2009-06-30 00:00:00	SIDE EFFECTS	5	0	Hi, I tried using coconut oil in my nasal rinse by mixing a 1/8 of a tsp of coconut oil into 16 oz of water mixed with one of those salt & baking soda mixes. I was hoping this would help my with my chronic sinusitis. I do not recommend doing this because now my nasal passages have been even more blocked then before and I am losing sleep over it. Please let me know if there are any suggestions how to counter this unexpected development from the coconut oil? Thanks! Again, do not try mixing coconut oil with your nasal rinse solution. Coconut oil works well on the outside of your body and with food but not in your nose.

Without a Neti Pot I tried a saline rinse using a straw and it did produce a lot of snot and with it some relief. I bought a small water bottle with a spout small enough to fit up your nose, performed a proper saline rinse (same method as with the Neti Pot) and voila - I can hear again. This works - it may be a little icky but worth it. I used 500mls warm water and roughly a tsp of ____ Salt. Thanks folks.

After 8 weeks of pain from a sinus infection, 3 doctor visits, 4 prescriptions of antibiotics and 2 bottles of narcotics, I found something that finally worked! I was up in the middle of the night desperate to find something to curb the most excruciating pain I've ever felt. This was the website that did it for me. I went to the pharmacy and purchased saline water. Bought the seasalt in pressured can but I'm sure any would work. I immediately felt relief and by the next morning was beginning to truly feel better. Used the spray 4 times a day for 4 days and am now using it night and day. No more meds flowing through my body!

6111	98	7064	Betty from Saskatoon, Sask., Canada	2008-12-10 00:00:00	WARNING!	6	0	I have no medical training. However, I would strongly recommend NOT using these remedies for young children. They would likely swallow the solution. The sodium content is too high for anyone to swallow. Also there is the likelihood and danger of children choking, or inhaling the solution into their lungs causing further infections. Use a nasal spray to gently draw the mucus out instead.
6112	98	7065	Cynthia from Clarksburg, MD, US	2008-11-07 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Sniffing warm salt water helped my sinus infection. I gargle with it for a sore throat but never thought about my sinuses. I suffer from large sinus cavities, so large that every dentist/hygienist I see remarks about them on my x-rays and always warn that I would have major pain when I get a sinus infection. I had just used an anti-biotic to cure one infection about 3 months ago and did not want to get any more. Found this site after the pain got so bad and the fastest fix was to try sniffing warm salt water. Tried it first last night, then again this morning. The pain is less and the swelling is going down. Tonight I will try the Apple Cider Vinegar steam therapy and see what happens. Thanks soooo much to everyone who contributes to this website!!!

I was taking shots but, had no luck. I moved and they wanted to start the damn shots over again from the weakest dosage. What a scam!!! So, I decided to do as I was always told. Spray the nose pathage with salt water. I first bought the solution from the drugstore and now, make my own and place in the bottle I bought. I spray up my nostrils in the shower, pinch my nose, shake and blow the crap out. Boy, the next few days I felt great. Now, I only use it as a monthly or so routine. If I sense I have an allergic affect or sinus flare up then, a spray or two a few days or a week or so will solve the problem. I've been sinus ache free and medicine free for a four years now. Darn glad I found your site to tell others and to learn how to take care of myself without a prescription (otherwise known as a low dosage poison). Thanks for the time, Bob!!!

I have even become VERY allergic to cigarette smoke and I used to SMOKE!I Live in Los Angeles but was visiting Miami and got a horrible sinus infection BACTERIAL with green boogers and sore throat etc. I used this mixture and felt relief in 20 minutes and have used it for 2 days and am draining everything and have lost all pain from the infection: buy saline nasal spray - $2 usually. I pulled the top off and added one cap full if HYDROGEN peroxide (store brand) and 4 drops of oil of oregano and 2 drops of baby shampoo . 2 squirts per nostril. leave it in there then blow out your nose. Use this throughout the day. I also oil pulled because of this infection and had a very messed up scratchy throat- that helped my voice sound more normal- and then before bed drank a hot cup of water with a whole clove of garlic cut in half with cayenne pepper. Its nasty if I could taste it! But by morning my coughs were effective and mucus is coming out! I am feeling much better. Don't forget your ACV and Vitamin C -- I get chewables I feel it also helps my sinuses pretty immediately. Hope this help you all with SINUS issues and SINUS Infections. I also do Hydrogen inhalation and love it. THANK YOU EARTHCLINIC.

Many OTC prepared saline product contain Benzalkonium or other preservatives. These can impair normal nasal cilia movement. Best to use a powder or salt to make your own solution. One teapoon of salt or Breathe.ease XL to 500 cc (or one pint) of water makes isotonic saline. This is usually best, though some prefer hypertonic. To make hypertonic use less water. Hypotonic - less salt is harmful to nasal function. If you tried OTC saline and found that it burned, try making it yourself without the preservatives.

I tried a variation of the neti pot alternative that was mentioned here on this forum. I emptied a nasal spray bottle and filled it with the warm salt water combo and sprayed all i could into the nasal passages. I was surprised how much gunk came out. Another nice surprise was that I am now feeling sooo much better!! The salt works it's magic fast - I had instant relief from the burning and the constant nasal drip. Next time I come across a neti pot, I think I'll pick it up! Hope you find relief from this remedy!!
6119	98	7071	Li from Wooster, OH	2007-03-18 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	About 1/2 way through a cold when I get stopped up and/or notice nasal secretions no longer clear, I know it is the start of sinus infection. Instead of ATB I have had much success with 1/2 to 1 cup warm tap or distilled water and 1 tsp salt (whatever dilution you feel you can tolerate). Using a clean baby nose syringe, I put head back and gently instill the saline water. It will drain through your sinuses and down throat. After everything loose I blow my nose and voila! No sinus infection brewing. And no ATB to mess up my belly. It is not the most pleasant thing but works terrific to avoid sinus infection. Hope you get the same success!

I took it for 10 days. This time I was desperate I did not want to take antibiotics again so started reading earthclinic. I bought a NeilMed Sinus Rinse Kit and tried their formula but did not help(it was to light the salt content).I took One tsp of salt(no iodine) and rinsed using neti pot technique.In two days my mucous was back to regular color. I have paid 18$ for the kit,you don't have to buy it as long as you can find a plastic bottle will do it. Thanks earthclinic for making this site available.

One year ago I was diagnosed with adult activity induced asthma. I have had to learn when i can and can't do long runs and then do more hikes. last year after being on 40 days of antibiotics really left me wore out. What has helped is using a nasal flush system with sea salt and warm water. I prefer a soft plastic bottle that allows for full gentle spray that flushes the sinus. Right now am at tail end of cold and through out was able to keep sinus open. did also use ACV and Hydrogen peroxide so far works great
6126	98	7078	A.C from Atlanta, GA	2007-01-07 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I had a cold for about a week and a half. It finally developed into one of the worst sinus infections I have ever had---to top it off, I am 6 months pregnant. After 2 days of pure misery, I went to the doctor. He gave me an rx for an antibiotic. After 2 days of taking it and pseudo ephedrine round the clock, I was still miserable. My head pounded, my nose was totally clogged on both sides, and my head felt like it was going to explode. Desperate to try anything, I went to Walgreens and purchased "SinuCleanse"--a product complete with a neti pot and saline packets. I used it every 2 hours for the first day, along with drinking the ACV/water mixture 2x's/day, and by the second day, I had relief. I could breathe and could tell my head was starting to clear up! By far the best thing that I had tried! Thanks for your website! It has helped tremendously!

I went to the natural foods store and bought a Neti Pot (a small pot made specifically to irrigate the sinuses). This pot uses regular table salt - NOT sea salt because it is too harsh - with water. I also used SilverBiotic. I am not sure which cured the infection but it lasted only two days. Usually it lasts several days. I was thrilled.

She said, "Just put some salt in the bottom of the spoon and cover it up with warm water. Stir it with your finger and sniff. Then hang your head over the bed and let it run into your sinus cavity

6131	98	7083	Heidi from Lake Stevens, WA	2006-07-06 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I've tried many of the remedies on your site (though not the inhaled ACV). All helped with my sinusitis to some degree, esp. the neti pot. Except hydrogen peroxide made the infection WORSE ... I think acidifying the nose helps, but making it more alkaline might make it worse for some people. I gave up dairy too, because that decidedly made things worse. Anyway, I still ended up on major antibiotics and steroids, though not as often. But what has worked consistently for me these days is a saline solution (as in the other posts) plus 3 drops of iodine solution per bottle of spray. Iodine kills anything, and it sinks into the skin. It's also very portable, so I can take my iodine solution on the plane or whatever. I imagine it might kill viruses that land in your nose after you've been next to a bunch of coughing people, though maybe that's just wishful thinking on my part. Iodine seems to promote skin healing (if the skin is unbroken), so maybe it makes the nose healthier too. So far, there has been no downside to using it twice a day. I sleep with no postnasal drip these days. Nice website, BTW!

I tried this (1/4 teaspoon salt and warm water)just a few minutes ago and I already have results. My head isn't hurting as bad. Almost instant relief with just trying it one time. I have been pumping myself full of medicines today and this is the most relief that I have had in 2 days. The only thing now is that my ear is stopped up. But I can deal with that. If and when the pain comes back I'll do it again. Thanks for the remedy..
6133	98	7085	AS from Boston	2006-03-23 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I've had chronic sinus infections to the point where alot of antibiotics won't work any more for me. I remembered being a kid and any time I got a sore throat my dad would have me gargle w/salt and it always helped. So one day I was desperate the antibiotics weren't working (mind you I was being put on antibiotics at least 4 times a yr for sinus infections) so I broke down and got a large bowl (big enough i could fit my face into it) put in warm water and salt i then pulled the water/salt into my nose held it then blew it out into the sink I would do this until the water was gone or I was tired of doing it. I have had sinus infections in the last year and every time I did the salt mixture sometimes I'd have to do it once or twice a day for two or three days. It cleared up the infection and I didn't have to be put on antibiotics. Hope this might be of help to others as well!

I was going to do a bit of a detoxing cleanse, and after I drank up the first glass of warm sea-salt and baking soda water my noses started running and I could breathe through my nose again. The entire infection cleared up soon afterwards. The only downside is that the salty water can give people an upset stomach.
6137	98	7089	Diane from Foley, AL	2008-12-02 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I work with crafts nearly every day and more during the months of November and December working with fine glitter. That's when my sinuses start getting a little congested. When I am through with the work I walk into the bathroom wash my hands and then fill my hands with luke warm water and sniff the water into my sinus cavity and blow several times and Walla all clear. If I don't get to do it and an infection starts I use a few drops of peroxide and it's clear within 10 to 15 minutes. It took a couple of years to realize it was what I was working with that caused the problem. Yes, I wear a mask most of the time but that stuff just flies everywhere.
6138	98	7090	Greta from Hillsboro, Oregon	2007-10-25 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Yes, ice cream, cheese, milk and even unsweetened yogurt all cause me to have sinus infections--even raw goat milk. The raw goats milk was the least innocuous. There are times when none of these bothers me. At one time, about four years ago, if I drank milk (yes, even raw) I would choke on a huge volume of white mucus. I discovered that if your spleen isn't working properly milk can cause a huge mucus buildup. I went to work on my spleen and, lo and behold, I could drink milk once more without any ill effects. I also learned that allergies and sensitivities to foods are related to how much of that substance is stored in our bodies, and certain deficiencies (vitamin, mineral or enzyme) deficiencies we may have. Some allergies may be overcome within seconds of taking the substance you are lacking. For instance 'swimmer's ear' can be 'cured' by taking the EFA'S that person is lacking. Swimmer's ear usually occurs on a hot sunny day when one has been out too long in the sun and gotten a burn, effectively burning up precious EFA's. So, I think this may help people understand why they may be sensitive to a substance at one moment, and not another, or why two people may eat the same food, but only one becomes sick

I tried mixing 1/2 cup of Apple Cider Vinegar with 1/2 cup of water and heating it on the stove until it gave off a good amount of steam. I inhaled the steam with my mouth and eyes closed and it has helped tremendously after 2 treatments. I plan to keep doing this until all symptoms are completely gone. I also made the spicy tomato juice, garlic, and cayenne "tea" and I'm sure that helped also.
6140	98	7092	Kristen from Phoenix, Az	2009-10-11 00:00:00	BETTER BUT NOT CURED	2	0	I have had a severe sinus infection for at least 2 weeks, but have head sinus problems with congestion for at least 8 weeks. I've been on an antiobiotic for the last 10 days and I'm still miserable, but not as miserable. I tried the steaming with the apple cider vinegar about an hour ago. I used one cup of water and one cup of apple cider vinegar put it on the stove top and put my sweatshirt hood over my head to help catch more of the fumes. I'm not 100% but I'm definitely much clearer. I'm hoping it works as well as everyone has been saying and that I'll be feeling much better in the next few days doing this a few times a day. The fumes are strong and it makes your house stink, but I feel better. I also use a neti pot daily twice a day as a preventative measure, and since my sinuses have been so clogged I can only use it about 1/3 of the time. 2/3 of the time my sinuses are so clogged that the water can't come out the other nostril.
6141	98	7093	Jen from Cincinnati, USA	2008-04-05 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I was really not sure about the ACV and breathing in the vapors, but I tried it because I was so tired of being sick. So when I got home from work I tried it and almost immediately the pressure in my sinus' was relieved. The next day all I had was a slight headached, but that was it! I am so excited and I would definetely recommend anyone who is suffering from this annoying problem to try it. Just 1 cup of ACV and 1 cup hot water boiled together. But definetely close your eyes and mouth it is a strong odor.
6142	99	7094	Daniel from Berlin, Germany	2010-02-05 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Hi! Its only 5 days ago i found your site. Want to give you great credits for all the good information i found here...thanks to all !! I found it cause i got back my painfull and disturbing sinus infection again (wich happens with me always 2 ,3 times a year,with headaches,totally ,,blocked,, nose and forhead,swollen eyes,no energy etc.) I even believe that this chronic sinus problem is due to some sort of unknown deficiency in my body that also makes me more ,,down,, then many others throughout the year..but this is a guess. anyway: This time i brewed my own mucus ,,releaser,, Since i discovered the kosher salt and the himalaya salt which is the main worker in this liquid, iam so happy to be able to quickly loosen up all the mucus up there so that it is not ,,exploding,, my head anymore. my recipe is (mix acording to feeling and strength and amount of solution needed): -nice Kosher salt or himalaya salt. -some healthy green tea -bit of lime -5 drops of good bee propolis (solution in alcohol) -bit of (good!) olive oil, or take self made oregano oil. (of course carefull with this strong recipe on kids please) mix until dissolved in a bowl that,s not your newly bought porcelin wedgewood bowl .the oils and the propolis will not dissolve of course and float around a bit on the liquid,no problem. Also the propolis is brownish and looks a bit strange...but in fact it,s very good stuff (bees use it in their nests as an anti virus) ...bring in the nose and let run. It can sting a bit for a few secs and is a sort of horsemethod i think
6143	99	7095	Abigail from Lawrence, Ks	2010-12-26 00:00:00	BETTER BUT NOT CURED	2	0	I've had a sinus infection for over a year. It showed up in varying degrees of intensity (some days there was just a mild ache and light post-nasal drip, some days there were huge headaches, some days there were major nose stuffiness/runniness and ear aches... ) but it was always there. I'm not a medicine taker, unless it's absolutely necessary, so mostly I just suffered with it. I drank hot tea and used heat packs on my face to bring relief when it was bad. Oh, and I used a colloidal silver nose spray; this helped a lot, but it never brought true healing, since the infection kept coming back. I don't have money to go to a doctor to get a prescription, and I read that antibiotics usually don't work on sinus infections anyway, since they are usually fungal in nature.

I went to my doctor a couple of weeks later and over the next few months I was given a variety of antibiotics, nasal sprays, singular, Claritin and a neti pot. I tried the silver spray and even used grape seed oil, oil pulling and apple cider vinegar but nothing worked until last week when my doctor gave me this simple advice. She said: "Add two drops of BABY SHAMPOO to your saline nasal spray twice a day." I started that three days ago and I feel a thousand times better!!!!!!!! I am sending her a thank you note next week. Spread the word, use 2 DROPS OF BABY SHAMPOO IN YOUR NASAL SPRAY!
6147	99	7099	B14a3w3 from Stewartstown, Pa	2011-03-20 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	For 2 years I have been using a capful of peroxide, premeasured NeilMed salt, 1 cup of warm water and 3 drops of Betadine once a day to prevent allergy sinus infections. I use a NeilMed squirt bottle to shoot the solution into one nasal passage and it comes out the other... Like a netipot would do. Instead of 2-3 infections a year, I have none. It has also prevented cracked skin over the cartilidge on the inside of my nose from post nasal drip irritation. My doctor said it was safe and to keep doing it since it helps. I have had infections for at least 20 years prior to trying this solution.
6148	99	7100	Fred from Atlanta, GA	2008-01-23 00:00:00	NAY	1	0	WARNING:'Sinus Infection Remedies - Danger!!! A MSDS sheet for Betadine stated the following: "Reactivity - A mixture of equal parts of a 10% povidone iodine solution (Betadine) and hydrogen peroxide 3% exploded about 100 minutes after mixing." Folks, this is the normal Betadine and hydrogen peroxide that you buy in the store! I was actually considering putting a few drops of these in some salt water and using it in an atomizing spray bottle (these are normally called "non-drip."). Not any more! On the other hand, after all of their warninings, I like the few drops of Betadine in a spray bottle of salt water, it works great! Betadine is one of the few things that kills viruses, it is stable in storage and and has a residual effect. To be on the safe side I will be keeping an eye out for possible iodine toxicity.

Betadine is an antiseptic. I tried this solution at the advice of a family physician, and it's the first thing that's ever worked. I did this rinse 4-6 times per day while I had the infection, and it got rid of it within one week. It's the first time I have kicked a sinus infection without antibiotics, and I usually get 4 sinus infections per year. I also added 1/4 tsp of hydrogen peroxide for good measure, but that's something I did, not the doctor's suggestion.
6150	99	7102	Mommabetty from Cape Cod, Ma	2012-01-08 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Sinus Infections: My grandfather was an herbalist during the early 1900's. His remedy, which I've always found effective, was to boil a large sliced onion with a tablespoon of coarse salt and enough ACV to cover. Bring to a boil then reduce to a simmer got 20-30 minutes. Breathing these vapors will sting a bit but is helpful. After cooking you can use 1-2 Tbs of this in warm water to drink or simple sip the straight concoction once cooled. It keeps well for a few weeks when refrigerated. Onion juice contains a natural antibiotic which compliments the mucolytic effect of the vinegar.

6152	99	7104	Ray from Tampa , Florida	2009-01-29 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	For a few years I was getting sinusitis which was dripping into my chest and causing further havoc. It would last several weeks usually and leave me miserable with a low grade fever the whole time. I had used Cayenne Pepper before but sporadically. I was told (don't remember where) that Cayenne Pepper in liquid form mixed with Fizzy Vitamin C would help clear it up. I purchased some CP and mixed it 20-25 drops into one or two packs of Emergen C and poured approx. 10 ounces of lemonade into the mix and drank it down. The effervessence of the Fizzy C seems to help deliver the cayenne pepper more actively to the mucus membranes. The CP must also kill some of the bacteria that is forming in the sinus cavity and mucus lining.
6153	99	7105	Samantha from Portland, Oregon	2007-10-17 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I found cayenne a great cure for pretty much everything some time ago. It wasnt long ago that I came down with a bad sinus infection, cough, and fatigue. I decided to boil water on the stove, and add cayenne(open 3 capsules and pour them in), crushed garlic(4 cloves),half an onion, and grated ginger. THIS COMBINATION IS AMAZING. It is SO powerful. The most vital ingredients are the cayenne and garlic, but the onion and ginger are also very helpful. Make sure and boil everything until the onion is mushy, and the garlic is too. Keep a lid on, but every so often inhale the steam from the boiling remedy.. very soothing! Pour it into a glass and drink the whole thing. It is very potent, so what I do is add honey to it and it really tastes like liquid food- like a soup base or something.

6157	99	7109	Momma.hambone from Detroit, Mi	2013-03-12 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I highly recommend snorting cayenne pepper! After reading reviews on Earth Clinic and being completely sick of being sick I finally decided to take the plunge. I am so happy I did. I did a small "bump" in each nostril from the end of a knife and immedietly could feel the pepper at work. It burned like something else for about 10 minutes but then, to my utter delight, I could BREATHE from my nose again! It has been 3 days; I can sleep at night, I can taste food again, I can breathe, I can talk to people without sounding like a weirdo. I still have some mucus, but its completely clear and nothing like it was before. Next time I even think I'm coming down with an infection I'm doing this straight away. Thank you all, and remember: your body is a healing machine. Be blessed in oneness!!

6159	99	7111	Rory from Houston, Tx	2011-11-22 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	This hurts, a lot. Do not use a lot! A little goes a LONG way. You do blow your knose a lot after, so that clears you up. Also, this pepper is a pain killer of sorts so it will make you feel better for a bit. But the initial pain was pretty amazing for me. Scale of 1 to 10 I'm thinking at least 7. It tappers off quickly, within a few minutes I'm down to a 5 or so. My nose feels like it's on fire. It seems to have helped. I used about 1/20th of a teaspoon, a very small amount. Then immediately blew my nose and most of it came out. I can now feel the pepper running down the back of my throat. Awesome.

I hate taking meds. Furthermore the antibotics did absolutely nothing when I did decide to take them. UGH!

6162	99	7114	Olodus  from Victoria, Bc, Canada	2009-11-28 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I've been battling a cold / flu / strep, not sure but its been suppressed after a healthy dose of cayenne and ACV, but the sinus thing has been lingering and i am prone to infection on the left side so i figured i'd give this snort a shot. This is not for the faint of heart. I didn't measure out anything particular just a tiny pinch for each nostril and bam. In the past week i've probally consumed roughly an eighth of the bottle of cayenne and nothing could have prepared me for this experience. Everything is drained, and my ear is feeling better already, my face is glowing and sinuses have been armed with napalm. This one is definately for the books.
6163	99	7115	Katie  from Edwardsville, Il, USA	2009-09-16 00:00:00	WORKED TEMPORARILY	3	0	Wow! What a rush! I woke up with sinus pain today, and came looking for remedies. After reading all the reviews on snorting cayenne pepper, I tentatively decided to give it a try. I sprinkled a pinch in my palm and used my pinky finger to scoop a TINY amount under my fingernail, and I inhaled it with my slightly clearer nostril. The burning got pretty intense within a few seconds, but within 30 seconds something shifted and I felt the pressure drop away. After a couple of minutes, I used it in the completely blocked nostril and it cleared almost immediately! Yes, the burning was INTENSE, but it was never unbearable. Honestly, it was a relief to feel something other than my sinus pressure and pain. I've heard of pharmaceutical companies using the chemical in pepper to find new ways to block pain- my experience shows that, at least temporarily, IT WORKS! Unfortunately, the pressure is already coming back. So, it works in the short term, but no lasting relief. I will try reapplying. If I find different results, I'll post them.

She said burned a little, I tried with a larger dose a my pinky, did both sides real quick. it burns and still feels hot now about 12 minutes ago, but i am breathing clear out of both nostrills, dont get worked up thinking about it.

OMG!!!! i tried to calm my nerves, but i was no use..i ran around the house sneezing..i had to blow my nose alot..once i calmed down, i was so exhausted that i went to sleep..but when i woke up, i was fine..i would reccomend it. i keep it in my medicie cabinet now
6166	99	7118	Diane from Clovis, NM	2009-04-08 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I tried cayenne pepper for sinus pressure in my head, when every time I coughed I had excruciating pain. I put about 1/8 of an inch under my pinkie finger nail and snorted in each nostril. Wow! what a rush. I didn't cough or sneeze, it just burned for about 30 seconds, but the headache and pressure were gone. I hope it lasts longer than everything else I've tried. It works, for now at least.

6169	99	7121	Megan from Cedar Falls, IA, USA	2009-02-19 00:00:00	NAY	1	0	I tried snorting cayenne pepper to relieve my sinus headache. I used roughly 1/32 of a teaspoon in my most obstructed nostril. Though my sinuses were cleared temporarily, the burning was hardly worth it. The left half of my face was inflamed, my eyes were running, and blowing my nose hurt like sin. I used my neti pot after, to try and quell the pain, with less than optimal results. Half an hour later, the burning has stopped and my congestion is back. Maybe I did something wrong, but I would not recommend this remedy.
6170	99	7122	Amy from Ocala, FL	2009-02-03 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	This has now become my favorite natural remedy for sinus infections!! My sinus infections are always so terribly painful that my teeth hurt...I woke up and knew I'd have to get on antibiotics if I didn't do something drastic so I snorted (as best as you can with both nasal passages clogged) cayenne pepper - not a huge amount, less than 1/8 teaspoon on the tip of my pinkie...it burns, yes, but I noticed almost immediate relief with breathing and pressure. Ten min. later and the burning sensation has dissipated (now it has a menthol type feeling) but the pressure/pain is completely gone. WORTH IT!!!!!

I have chronic sinus problems, it got so bad once that I was desperate. I usually put 1/2 teaspoon of salt in a large glass of warm water and snuff it up my nose. Well, I added a pinch of cayenne to the saline. I snuffed it up my nose, and it burned for about two seconds, then the burning quickly subsided. Yes, it stopped what I suppose was a sinus infection. Any way I felt better for a long time. Gary

I tried the pepper, by snorting it, and within minutes it worked. I then put a 1/2 teaspoon of Cayenne Pepper in my green tea, and I was amazed the power of pepper! I didnt have to go to the doctor. We need to put this in cans. it works!

My mother gave me a bottle of Sinus Buster- a natural pepper spray- and I tried it.It stings some, but does it open up your sinuses. The sinus infection was gone in two days. I have since had another sinus infection and got the same results the second time I used it. It took about 1 spray in each nostril, 1x a day for 2-3 days.

It felt great just after I was upside-down, but within ten minutes I was stuffed to the max again. May try it again tomorrow, but wonder how many times/day I can do it without hurting my sinuses.
6175	99	7127	Adeleine from Portland, Oregon	2008-03-20 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	cayenne snorting: This crap works! Immediate relief. Lots of blowing the nose after, particularly if you don't manage to sneeze. Huge globs of infection came out after I tried this. However, I think I used too much cayenne. I would suggest using 2 lines, each one just one quarter to one sixth the size of your pinky fingernail (width and length). Anyway, great remedy if you have eyes you can't even move around anymore because there is so much pressure behind them causing pain.
6176	99	7128	Tanya from Northglenn, Colorado	2008-02-13 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Alright Ive got a funny yet true story...my sister and I cought a cold. (And shes the type thats pron to sinus infections) So I was tryin to find any kind of remedies for her(cuz she doesnt have med.insurance). N I came across this page and read what Greg from TN did for his sinus infection. Sniffing CAYENNE PEPPER...So with my sister yellin about how she do anything to get the elephant off her head(sinus pressure), I started cutting the Cayenne Pepper into lines. After cutting 2 lines(one for each side) I watched and by far it was the most entertainingly/hilarious thing Ive ever seen! She jumped around and kept saying "it burns, it burns". Secs after snorting up those 2 lines, the pressure was gone! Greg, your right...IT WORKS!
6177	99	7129	Greg from Nashville, TN	2007-10-31 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I was reading your cures for sinus infections. I had the worst one ever. I read that people were using cayenne, so I decided that mine was so bad I would just snort it. Well, yes it burns quite a bit, but the effects were immediate!!!! My headache went away and the pressure in my eyes quit also. Just wait a couple of minutes, sneeze and blow your nose. It's a pretty good rush and you will sweat, but it worked for me. I keep it in my medicine cabinet now.

I use the mixture three, sometimes four times a day. Make sure you keep it refrigerated. here is a link for more information about chlorophyll: http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,764228,00.html I also stay away from dairy, wheat and soy products. In fact I'm completely eliminating soy from my diet.

MAKE SURE the coconut oil is liquified first, though! You can just put a teaspoon or so into a plastic cup & run hot water over it until you see it change to liquid form. You don't want to put it up your nose when it's solid - it could stuff things up!
6181	100	7133	Moriah	2006-02-27 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	i had a horrible sinus infection so i decided to use the 3% peroxide. i didn't have a spray bottle so i took a couple of cotton swabs and soaked them in peroxide, put them inside my nose and breathed in real slow. My nose started stinging but i did it again a couple more times then all of a sudden my nose started pouring out (you know what) for like 10 minutes. I can breathe easier and and my nose feels fantastic. MY head doesn't feel blocked up so i am definitely a believer.
6182	100	7134	Joe from New York, Ny	2013-06-05 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I use the hydrogen peroxide netti pot irrigation remedy for my sinus infections and it works great. I alternate with salt water to wash away any remaining hydrogen peroxide. I'm going to add the ACV as a supplement as well. My sinus infections won't go away with antibiotics but this does the trick. a few words of caution. It doesn't take much hydrogen peroxide. I use a small amount from a dropper and that is powerful enough once mixed in with a netti pot. Be careful over doing it because I think you can end up irritating the sinuses rather than healing them. Also you want to use filtered water as some parasites live in tap water and while tap water is safe to drink, these parasites can get into your body via the nasal passage. There are cases of this and those parasites are dangerous, even if rare.

I recently tried the Peroxide, Salt, and saline wash method. So far it's the only thing that's really done much at all to help with my sinus pressure and pain. I am also drinking Apple Cider Vinegar at each meal. I feel that between the two it is really helping and there's nothing in either of these things that will adversely affect my baby. I love home remedies!

I hadn't been able to breathe through my nostrils and I had enough so I google home rememdies for sinus infections and came across this amazing website! I boiled a small pot of water and poured the water into a nice size bowl. I added 2 tbs of sea salt and hydrogen peroxide. I used a towel to cover my head to make sure none of the steam escaped. The first minute of holding my head in the steam I felt movement. My nose started dripping and my left nostril opened. I could breathe! I couldn't handle the steam for more than 10 minutes. I tried the steam again later in the day and my right nostril opened. I was able to breathe! Love love love love love this website!
6194	100	7146	Deirdre from Port Chester, NY	2006-04-18 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	though not prone to chronic sinus infections like many others posting here, I have had a couple of doozies and know what they feel like and how bad they can get and how long they can drag on, and I know the signs of the beginning of the onslaught. Over the past weekend seasonal allergies seemed to have kicked another one into full swing, I had a headache for three days, so bad that my TEETH had started to really hurt, and the mucus coming out when I blew my nose was dark green to brown; it was NOT headed in a good direction. I sensed a trip to the doctor sometime this week (IF I could even get an appointment), and with no health insurance, that just wasn't in the budget. But I knew this wasn't going to clear up on its own, so I found this site online, decided to try something home-based to see if I could nip it in the bud, as I prefer to avoid antibiotics whenever possible. Wasn't sure about the ratios/portions in some of these listings, so here's what I tried, winging it on my own. It POSITIVELY WORKED!!! Within less than a half hour, my headache was gone, the sinus pressure was gone, I was breathing through my nose, I ended up with a good night's sleep for the first time in almost a week, and my teeth no longer hurt! The discomfort level of the solution was minimal (it is uncomfortable to put liquid up your nose, for sure, and it DOES sting/burn just a little bit), the ease of procuring the ingredients and making it was amazing!

6186	100	7138	Sarah from Hill Afb, Utah	2011-02-08 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Hi all, I have had a cold, now sinus infection, for 3 weeks now(mainly in my left sinus passages). I NEVER write comments on sites where I find random remedies for myself/animals/husband/etc. but this site is amazing! I had tried the Apple Cider Vinegar mixed with water(yuck! )and didnt really see/feel any immediate results but felt a little difference in my right nostril, I then put my head over a mix of 3 TBS peroxide and 3 TBS salt mixed with enough hot hot hot water to fill the bowl and put a towel over my head and inhaled for 15 mins, my right sinus was completely cleared but my left was still being stubborn. I had been using the AYR saline solution my doc had given and wasnt seeing any results (felt worse actually) so I tried the hydrogen peroxide and sea salt with water mix.... AMAZING!!! My left nostril cleared up almost completely for about 10 mins and then I went back an hour later and did it again, feeling so much better! I went straight to my laptop to write this! I cannot thank you enough, I have to go to work and school full time during the week and do not have time to be sick and get headaches every time I move my head :(.... Let alone do it all with a horrible sinus infection that put me right back into bed every morning for about 3 days. Yes, it does burn a bit, I am a huge sissy so I also teared up a little too, but it is totally worth it. I will be doing this once more in the morning and again tomorrow night and repeat until its gone. I do have two notes though: 1. I have been on Amoxicillin for 2 days now (no results, felt worse) and I am not discontinuing the antibiotic bcz I do feel as though it will help keep my infection AWAY, but for immediate results, I felt this saline remedy is best. 2. DO NOT BLOW YOUR NOSE TOO HARD!!!! I have witnessed a friend do this and blow out her ear drum and then get an infection in her ear from blowing the infection into it(she was blowing VERY HARD haha). If you have too much sinus pressure/it hurts to blow your nose, only blow it VERY gently and dont put ur finger over the other nostril to just get the boogies out of one side, leave both nostrils completely open. Thank you again so much for all your responses/advice and for providing such a wonderful site!! I will be back again when the next sickness comes my way! PS I also am planning on trying the Tomato Spice Tea tomorrow, no tomato juice/V8 at the moment and I will update you as I (hopefully!! ) get better!! :) Sarah

It has totally healed my nasal membranes and I no longer get sinus infections, and I very seldom have to do any type of sinus flooding anymore. My sinuses feel great! I first started documenting my discovery on the Internet in 2003 and I've developed full documentation about "Upside Down Sinus Flooding" at http://home.bellsouth.net/p/PWP-upsidedown The documentation contains warnings about the risk, to the Eustachian Tubes and Middle Ears, from flooding the nasal passages with any liquid. Those wishing to try a sinus flooding with Hydrogen Peroxide, Baking Soda and Kosher Salt should first check with their doctor.
6189	100	7141	Richie from Newport, NC	2007-02-21 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have been taking pain killers for four(4) months now, have noticed mucus was becoming very thick and amber in color. being a person who pays attention to what comes out of my body, I became alarmed. I do not not like the idea of taking prescriptions, but at the time this was my option. Anyway, long story short; found your site, agree with most of your cures, but I also know that one size does not fit all. I tried most of your sinus remedies, paid attention to what ingredients were working, and found a simple technique to drain sinuses early morning w/little prep work. Turn on hot water, grab coffee cup, put 1 tsp sea salt, 1/2 tsp H202, small amount of hot water( enough to make paste out of sea salt) take q-tip, dip in solution until saturated, put in nostril , tilt head back and inhale deep. This will make you cry, but your sinuses will drain immediately. I suppose, just based on my own exp. that when taking meds, the binders in the meds that can't or don't get broke down find something else to bind to in your body. For me, it has been my mucus. Which also lends me to believe that the cure is worst then the disease, because we don't know how long these things can stay in our system or what else they are attaching them selves to that can become problematic over the course of your life.
6190	100	7142	Shannon from San Diego, CA	2007-02-08 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	The Hydrogen Peroxide and Salt remedy mentioned really helped! As a vegan, I rarely get sick more than once a year (I agree with the feedback on the site that links dairy and preservatives to a number of ailments). I was born asthmatic and never given any help other than rescue inhalers. Which means that I have very weak lungs; and in turn that every sickness I get goes straight to my lungs. This season I had already had two sinus infections which resulted in both massive chest congestion and my first ever eye infection. When I woke up 2 days ago with that familiar sinus pressure and lung congestion I was definitely frustrated. My last sinus infection was so severe that I went to the doctor and got antibiotics (something I haven't done in years). I was determined not to have to do that this time. I stumbled upon your site and found a remedy that I could make from items I already had in my home. After combining the hydrogen peroxide and salt with boiling water and sticking a towel over my head for 15 mins to breathe in the steam, one sinus completely cleared. I repeated the process but didn't get the same result on the other side. However, when I woke up this morning, I could breathe out of both nostrils with a very minimal amount of congestion! I'm very excited! In addition, I'm going to try oil pulling with sesame oil today to see if it helps clear some of the mucous from my lungs. I look forward to further success!
6191	100	7143	Mike from Newton, NJ	2006-10-25 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	After suffering for three days with my twice/yr sinus infection and not getting any sleep, I wandered into the computer room @ 2am and did a search for a homemade remedy. I grew up visiting a grandmother who NEVER had a medicine in her house. It was always a 'concoction' that usually tasted horrible, but worked like a charm (ie. fresh cracked pepper in a shot of brandy before bedtime when you had a head cold. Tell that one to child services, but it put you out and you woke up without any symptoms! 100% better than Nyquil) Anyhow.....since it was so early in the morning and I couldn't find a eye dropper without waking the rest of the clan, I improvised with placing 3 TBS of peroxide, 3 TBS of salt in a bowl (don't use stainless steel, trust me!) and added boiling water. With a towel over my head for 15 minute, it work wonders, enough to let me go to sleep....until 6am, when WHAM! I awoke to the cool rush of air that hit my now clear sinuses!!!! I actually felt the pop and the rush it was so intense. I will never suffer through a sinus infection, that usually went into my chest for a few weeks, again!

First i uses Flonase for about 6month, it helped and gave me relief but did not cure anything, and that at the price of about $90.00 a bottle! Then i went to a specialist who gave me a checkup and recommended Neil Med Sinus Rinse, also very good and helped BUT again did not cure anything!He recommended a CAT scan next and since i have to pay for it cash i waited . So far i spend about $1000.00 on my sinus problem and still have it. then i found THIS WEBSITE, and after reading all he recommendations i decided to go to the grocery store and fix my self a solution of the mentioned items. So here is what i did and it had an UNBELIVABLE POSITIVE EFFECT! at the cost of less then $1.00 !!!
6199	101	7151	Frank from Palm Beach, FL	2006-04-11 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Chronic sinusitis is caused by aspergillis fungus, a plant and vegetation borne fungus.There are several variants but aspergillis niger is the most common.. When the immune system is overloaded, the fungus creates a bacterial infection. Clearing the bacterial infection does not clear the cause. Aspergillis nosodes are available from Dolisos Homeopathic. two doses of 8 pellets three days apart will normally clear the fungus and end sinus problems permanently. If aspergillis niger doesn't work, try the other four variants. Any health food store carrying dolisos products can get these for you. (about $5.00) note this will cure the cause of the infection, not the current bacterial infection. generally sticta pulmonaria 30x and or stannum mettalicum 30x ; 4 tablets ,3times day will clear the bacterial infection.

I used to take antibiotics at least once a year for sinus infections until 12 years ago when my naturopathic doctor recommended horseradish. Since then, I have had no problems if I eat a lot of horeradish (usually about a jar a day) at the first sign of infection. Until now, that is. I have developed a sinus infection and the horseradish I just brought home from the grocery store is not strong enough. So, I am going to try some of the other things listed here, at least until I can get my hands on some stronger horseradish.

Many people get sinus infections during the winter months being cooped up in the house. I prefer the Vick's Vaporizer in my bedroom and I try to keep it boiling @ night. Servicing your heater filters regularly is important too, filters should be changed @ month. At the first sign of a sinus infection I snort a sea salt, baking soda, distilled water solution up my nose 2x's a day, That really helps. 1cup distilled water 1tsp. sea salt, 1/4 tsp soda, slightly heat in microwave, put in a baby bulb and snort it up your nose.

6206	101	7158	Minerva from Baton Rouge, LA	2009-04-18 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Like many people who have written on this site, I suffered with sinus infections until the bouts with them became more frequent and intolerable. I would break down every year and get a steroid shot after becoming desperate. After finding this site, however, I decided to try the neti pot and added a tablespoon of hydrogen peroxide to the already pre-mixed solution packet in lukewarm water. I was not looking for a miracle, but must say that I feel like a new person after only a day and a half. I have used the solution three times and can tell that my glands are not as swollen and that my sinus passages are starting to open. I no longer have the eye or face pressure that is so painful with an infection. Truthfully, the mixture is not pleasant, but it works. After the first time you use it, you will get your same symptoms returning, but it is after the second/third use that you realize that you are being cured of your actual infection. Thanks to this web site I hope to never need antibiotics again. Thank you.

I am a big believer in natural remedies (probiotics rock!) but my wife is a HUGE skeptic. She has been suffering from severe headaches with pressure in her forehead, eyes and cheeks for about a month. She has always had problems with her sinuses and has tried a neti pot with a saline solution, but with no luck. Before my wife went off to the doctor for another round of antibiotics (boo!) I found your website. What an incredible source of information. I followed some of the postings here and mixed up a 50/50 mix of lukewarm water and hydrogen peroxide in her neti pot. Almost instantly she said the pressure in her head subsided and her nose started pouring. As other people have commented the mucus was thinner and whiter than before and it did sting when she first started. But says it is definitely worth it.
6208	101	7160	Lori from Kapaa, Hawaii	2009-01-16 00:00:00	NAY	1	0	I have had sinus congestion for the past several days real bad. I decided to try the 50/50 Peroxide/Water mix and squirt in each nostril. It burned like people said on your site and my nose started running like crazy, but it did NOT clear up my sinuses. Actually it increased the pressure in my sinuses so much that I did not sleep well at all, had a sinus headache, and my cheek bones hurt. I would not try that again.
6209	101	7161	Sarah from Baltimore. MD, USA	2008-04-07 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	My husband had been struggling with a sinus infection, he started taking 5 drops of hydrogen peroxide in a glass of water a couple times a day. The second day we doubled the dose and a few minutes later a ball of disgustingly yellow and green mucus came out flying from his mouth... I mean flying. It was pretty impressive. The nest of the infection was gone. Thanks HP!
6210	101	7162	Larabelle from Dallas, Texas	2008-01-15 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have a neti pot and for sometime had been using distilled water, salt, and baking soda but tonight that did not work. My sinuses were aching and it is 11pm. I have to be up for work at 4:30am. I need my sleep because I am a registered nurse and my unit is always busy. Anyway I immediately came to your site to see what other remedies I could use. You may ask why did I not seek out one of my doctors to write an antibiotic prescription for me. Well, good question as a nurse I see repeatively people's kidneys damaged as well as yeast overgrowth due to antibiotics and I refuse to become one of the many with those conditions. Also I have found that alternative remedies found on this site work soo much better and faster. So anyway I decided to try 1/2 hydrogen peroxide and half water. IT WORKED!!! THANK YOU EARTH CLINIC FOR BEING HERE WHEN I NEED YOU!!
6212	101	7164	April from Guyton, GA	2006-12-25 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I mixed about 6 parts water with 1 part hydrogen peroxide (the regularly available kind). I hung my head upside down off the side of the bed and had my husband squirt a little bit of the mixture into each nostril with a dropper. It DID burn, but I kept it in there as long as I could stand it, moving my face around to move the mixture through my sinuses. A few minutes after sitting back up, the mucous starting coming out of my nose and throat. I blew my nose for about 10-20 minutes and coughed up some mucous. It isn't pretty, but it worked. I did feel flush for several minutes afterward, too. That little bit of discomfort is worth the relief.
6213	101	7165	Sam from Boston	2006-07-26 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have been suffering with my sinuses for last 6 months and i just came to realize i had sinusitis few days ago when i came to this website and i had my acid reflux (GERD) from last 6 years. I am living healthy lifestyle and eating fruits and vegetables and everything is in right balance but i was so confused what was wrong with me. I went to eye doctor first and then he told me to see my primary care physician, and he gave me painkillers first and then i was visiting him regularly and we did CT Scan as well. He was not able to see my sinus issue. So then i realized i have not cleared my nose properly in last 3-4 months, then it hit me and i was like damn-- i had sinusitis and doc had no idea that i was suffering from this unbearable pain. To come to the point, i used just hydrogen peroxide yesterday and holy cow i feel much better it is not all cured yet but i am grateful that if i had not come here to this site, i would have never known. And i am also taking apple cider vinegar with honey and it is helping a lot as well. Earth Clinic i want to thank you from the bottom of my heart.

It burns if you have an infection but it works great! Cures a sinus infection every time! If you have drainage, gargle with the same mixture and it will dry up the mucus in your throat.
6216	102	7168	Eventgal from Gladewater, Tx	2013-04-29 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Was blowing out bloody, yellow yucky stuff for a full week. I used garlic in my neti pot from instructions I found on YouTube. Chop up a few garlic cloves and LET THEM SIT FOR 15 MIN. Pour boiling water OVER the cloves, and then dispose of the garlic. Add sea salt (I use the packets). Use this mixture in the neti pot once it cools. My sinuses were so irritated that the first treatment was... Uh, exhilerating... Almost painful. The second was much better. I did three treatments (no more than 2 a day) and I was 100% cured. Really could have stopped after the second treatment because I felt SO MUCH BETTER. From experience, the garlic worked for me.

6218	102	7170	Udarg from Boise, Idaho	2012-04-05 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I make a home preparation of a garlic solution by mashing 8 to 10 cloves of garlic and pouring just enough hot water over the top to cover and allow to stand for 2 days. I then strain out the garlic and add 1/2 to 1 teaspoonful of table salt to the mix and put the garlic-salt water into a small, clean vessel with a well fitted lid. When an infection is present I dip a Q-tip into the solution and carefully insert it into the affected sides nostril. I leave it in place until the person cannot stand it any longer. Once I remove the garlic saturated Q-tip I have them blow their nose. It doesn't take more than a few of these treatments to clear up a sinus infection. You will know it is clearing because the nasal mucus will begin losing the yellow or green color and begin to turn clear again.

Whats the best thing for me to do? I have vinegar in the house I can try that and see what happens.
6220	102	7172	Michelle from Albuquerque, NW	2007-01-09 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Fresh Garlic cured my Bronchitis and Sinus Infection. 1 finely diced clove (not the entire bulb) 3x's daily with any complimentary food that has been cooled almost to room temp (eg. diced tomatoes, avocado, chicken noodle soup, spaghetti sauce, pizza, or even apple pie.) Garlic is a natural antibiotic and antifungal. Within an hour or so, easier to breather and think, in 4 days cleared up symptoms. Took for 7 days to eliminate any chance of becoming ill again. Drawbacks: odiferous breath, and the odor also emanates from the pores of the skin. Use strong breath mints/cologne/essential oils to your liking.

I drank some Tomato Tea and now I'm sipping on ACV and honey. I also did my Russian Garlic Cure (see recipe below). Something is kicking in that's for sure! For two weeks I have had much congestion and coughing..very aggravating to say the least. So I am happy to report that things are calming down! All ideas people post on here are worth trying and I am one of those people who will try most 'home remedies' before I will go to a doctor. The poor things don't have a clue about stuff like this.. bless them. Most 'cures' are in our kitchen's anyway. One that I have had success with is one the Russians use. (Now I see why they are so ticked off..lol).

6227	102	7179	Robin from Westhampton, Ny, Usa	2011-01-28 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I've had a sinus headache for over 2 months with no nasal congestion and no mucus (It actually took me 2 months to figure out it was even a sinus problem at all). Wanting to avoid antibiotics, I tried the Neti pot for the first time ever, using a mixture of salt and colloidal silver. After 5 days of this at 2-3 rinses per day, I had few/no results and not even a runny nose. I still had severe headaches and facial pain in my cheeks and upper jaw. After reading this site, I tried Grapefruit Seed Extract. Dose 1 opened up the flood gates! I feel THAT strongly about it that I didn't want to wait until tomorrow for Dose 2 to write about it here. I used 7 drops in the saline solution but diluted it half way through because it was too strong to handle.

I was on my 3rd round of antibiotics (I'm allergic to many)for sinus infection. I've had headaches for 2-3 months...every day. The crown of my head, base of my skull, but the worst was when I bent over. I thought my forehead would burst.

6231	102	7183	Jamila from Washington, DC	2008-11-15 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I woke up with a sinus infection on Thursday and suffered through the day on Dayquil. Friday morning, I drank 2 tbs of ACV in 8 oz of water. That helped a little bit. I found this website and read posts about GSE, oil pulling and the neti pot. I went to Whole Foods for the neti pot and GSE. Friday afternoon and evening, the neti pot helped ease sinus pressure and prompted drainage. This morning Saturday, I woke up and did oil pulling. Then, I added 4 drops of GSE to the neti pot (8 oz water with 1/4 tsp salt). I used this combo-one for each nostril. Right now, I feel great. My sinus pressure is gone and my congestion is rapidly draining as I type this post. I am pretty sure combining the GSE with the neti pot treatment did the trick and I will continue this for at least five days to cure my sinus infection. Good luck and be peaceful!
6232	102	7184	MEG from Augusta, Georgia	2007-11-20 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I just wanted to share my story as well. I became ill when my son contracted viral meningitis on a trip. Traveling back in the car, I could only take lots of EmergenC. For the next few days, I took the EmergenC with GAIA Echinacea three times a day and got lots of rest. It seemed to work after four days, so I stopped the treatments. Well I think I got a secondary infection because my lymph nodes became swollen and my sinuses became infected. I irrigated my nose with grapefruit seed extract (diluted) but some undiluted liquid got in my right sinus and caused a lot of pain. Discouraged and about to go to the doctor for antibiotics, I come across your wonderful website. I first started back on the C & Echinacea but added the Grapefruit seed extract (5 drops in 12 oz water). My sinuses were cured in one day! That same day I drank 12 oz of water with 3 tbsp. of ACV. The next day the affected area was in my throat. I made warm ACV with lemon (3 tbsp) and honey (2tbsp) and drank as much as I could. The day after that I felt I only had laryngitis. So I found Ted's wonderful receipe for Green Tea with baking soda (1/4 tsp). I have done this for two mornings and feel almost back to normal. Thanks to all your contributors, I am cured in a matter of a few days! You guys are awesome, especially Ted.
6233	102	7185	Kim from Bronx, NY	2007-05-27 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have been reading your website and have been especially interested in your sinus remedies. I have been trying acv and grapefruit seed extract. I have been battling sinus infections since September have been on about 5 courses of antibotics. I am on antibotics right now because when I went to the ENT docter he said I have a sinus infection. What I find strange is I never get a runny nose I just get a lot of pain in my teeth pressure on the side of my nose and headache and I feel allergic to everything. Anyway was wondering I notice I started getting the sinus infections when I started taking these diets products that are soy based. Do you think there is a connection ? I feel that the grape fruit seed extract and acv are working the only thing that I notice is about 2 hours after I take the grape fruit seed extract I feel alot of chest congestion then I get this dry cought for a bit. I think its the grape fruit seed extract working. I am looking into the candida possibilities.

6236	102	7188	Katie from Camano Island, WA	2009-06-16 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have had two severe sinus infection flare ups over the last two months. The post nasal drip from this infection has caused me to have SEVERE laringitis, so severe that i could not talk at all. As if my vocal cords were completely gone. I could only use sign language and even whispering hurt my throat and head. Has anyone ever had this problem? I have looked everywhere on the internet and have not found one story of laringitis caused by a sinus infection. I am using 13 drops of GSE and 1/8 tsp. of sea salt mixed in 3/4 cup warm water. i use a full eye dropper, tilt my head back and squirt it up both nostrils. Then i quickly plug my nose and put my head down between my legs. I plug one nostril and gently breath in through the other. Doing the same with the other nostril and back and forth for about 1 minute. When i first started doing this, the pressure in my sinus was almost unbearable. But now on my 5th day of doing this about 3-5 times a day, the pressure is gone. I still have laringitis but it is not lasting as long as my first bout with this infection. I am also starting the ACV drink. If anyone has had this Laringitis trouble, please let me know. I was completely mute for 3 days!!!
6354	109	7271	Angelina from Apeldoorn, Netherlands	2007-03-04 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	This is a cure I got from my mom. With a lamp without a lampshade and easy to handle place a handkerchief or similar cloth over your face and use the now turned on light bulb (careful!! only adults should do this) massage your sinus areas until the heat gets too much and then wait a while and start again. Make sure you don´t go outside or catch cold or wind and do this for several days until symptoms disappear. She never had another infection again.
6237	103	7189	Michelle Cheri from Los Angeles, Ca	2010-09-21 00:00:00	QUESTION	7	0	Hi all! So, I have had sinus issues for 10 years or so, and have been dizzy (not vertigo, already went to an ear doctor for a test, my inner ear is fine) for an entire year. The doc did a CT scan and said I have significant sinusitis (also I have acid reflux). I do NOT want to do antibiotics, so I tried all the remedies here: oil pulling (sesame) 2x/day, hydrogen peroxide/sea salt/baking soda rinse in my SinuRinse nedi med bottle 2 or 3x/day (8oz filtered water, 1/2 teaspoon b. S. , 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1 1/2 TB h. P. ), ACV/water mix 2x/day (2-3 TB), steam inhalations w/ eucalyptus 1-2x/day, humidifier at night, and taking all the herbs recommended for sinus echinacea 3x/day, diet of no dairy no wheat no refined sugar no meat only veggies (lots of onion and garlic) fruit nuts and beans, hot tea, no caffeine or alcohol... I mean I'm doin it all here. The weird part is I havent had any pain (knock on wood) just stuffiness and dizziness all the time and I saw the ct scan pics and how much mucous there is in my maxillary sinus cavity. I have been doing all this for 5 days. My stuffiness is kind of subsiding, but comes and goes and the sinus rinse seems to make me more stuffier later. Still dizzy. Don't get a ton of mucous coming out of me when I do all this, maybe just a little, so my sinus cavity doesnt seem to be draining... And I'm not experiencing any detox effects. My questions are has anyone heard of dizziness being a symptom of sinusitis? and why isn't any of this working? PLUS when I oil pull, after 20 minutes the oil is still yellow while of course also being thicker and stuff, but isn't it supposed to be white? I also have a hard time not swallowing a bit of it while its in my mouth, does that happen to any of you? please help

Tried the ACV in a drink with raw honey, and mixed with my salt water for the neti pot for several days now. Doesn't seem to help much.

I am on ACV, GSE, Nasal pot, vit c 2000mg/day,garlic pills, trying to drink plenty of water each day, inhaling ACV as well. I have some relief but the pain the head is there, comes and goes, worse at night. I am leaving for India in 3 day and am desperate to find a cure. The cure may come but I need to see more improvement. I have read so many posts by so many good people giving there solutions and their experiences. I guess I will just continue what I am doing. I will not go to a doctor to take antibiotics they don't work for me. Well, thanks for allowing me to vent and when I find a cure or something that has really made the difference with these chronic horrible sinuse problems I will post it. Bill
6241	103	7193	Mary from Chesapeake, VA	2009-02-15 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	This has been the most effective cure for congestion and sinus infection I have found to date. Use a saline wash (Neti Pot) with 1/4 teaspoom of non-idodized salt + 1/8 teaspoon of powdered grapefruit seed extract (found in vitamin/health store). Chew two cloves of garlic twice daily. It helps to drain the sinuses. Garlic contains Allicin, a broad spectrum antibiotic. It's antiviral and antibacterial, as well as anti-microbial. Drink mugs of steaming hot chicken soup. It's comforting and hydrating and helps to loosen mucous. Take a teaspoonful of honey before bed to soothe sore throat and reduce coughing. This is amazing--something that tastes great and really works! Eat two-three oranges or tangerines daily. Keep up your circulation by walking lightly daily (20 minutes) at the tail end of your cold. Increased circulation boosts the immune system and stimulates the lymph nodes to produce the killer white blood cells. Drink a healthful smoothie of pineapple juice, strawberries and blueberries to strengthen your immune system. DO NOT eat anything fatty or fried foods that could plug up your digestive system. If you cramp up and get constipated you slow down your recovery from a cold or sinus infection.
6242	103	7194	D. from Atl, GA	2008-07-19 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I think the ACV is great for thinning mucous of a sinus infection,but it hasn't worked well for an infection that has been going on for a number of days. I just got back from an 8 day trip and the plane (going and coming) reaked havoc on my congested sinus passages. While I was out of town, I stopped by a Whole Foods and got some acv to take. I kept my pH alkaline by sipping some acv in a water bottle every 5-10 minutes. It certainly made my nose run! I also squirted 3% hydrogen peroxide from a nasal spray bottle up each nostril... just one squirt. It burned like crazy for a minute, but definitely helped. When things got stirred up again after flying home, I decided to up my water intake (One glass of water every 2 hours), take oregano oil (to fight the infection), and one turmeric capsule (to reduce inflammation). The wild oregano oil turned my thick yellow mucous to clear in about an hour. I will continue all of this (lots of water, turmeric, oregano oil, acv) until the infection is gone. Lot of hard work to clobber the infection, but better than antibiotics. Which isn't to say I would refuse antibiotics if I really needed them! But if I don't have to, I don't.

I am 35 and still have my wisdom teeth, and agree with the person on here that said they think there is a connection between wisdom teeth and sinus pressure and infections. Anyway I wanted to suggest to everyone on here to try the greatest sinus remedy of all it is called Cyclone Cider and is available at major health food store chains. It is a mixture of apple cider vinegar, cayenne pepper, garlic horseradish root, ginger root, vitamin c, onion and parsley SO ALL bases are covered. It is a little pricey BUT worth it because I have not been able to duplicate its snappy tom type flavor myself. It works wonders and can be used in food, with apple juice of alone!

I emptied a little nasal spray bottle to put my own concoction. I filled it about 1/3 of the way with water-added about 1/8 tsp. salt, one drop of oil of oregano, and one drop of Apple Cider Vinegar. I spray this up my nose several times a day. In two days, my sinuses and cleared up!
6245	103	7197	Kimber from North Illinois	2013-05-17 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	After 2 week of dealing with severe spring allergies which consisted of major head/ sinus congestion, watery eyes, and coughing from post nasal drip I felt maybe maybe a trip to the doctor might be a next step. I was taking a decongestant, a antihistamine , netti pot, and Apple Cider Vinegar 2x's per day, with all this I was feeling like a sinus infection was brewing- adding pressure and headache. So to get to the point- I hate going to the doctor and trying to handle this the best way I knew how. Desperate to get rid of this brewing sinus infection I took 1 tablespoon of Apple Cider Vinegar and added to the netti pot with warm water. After completing only 1/2 the treatment because it was very uncomfortable burning through my sinus cavity I had to stop. Well be prepared- w/ a box of Kleenex because war had been declared!!! With in minutes stuff/ infection was on its way out. Within an hour relief was being felt. As uncomfortable as the neti pot was with Apple Cider Vinegar the result were quick and immediate. Bye bye infection!

I was VERY congested and had such pressure my eye balls, upper cheek bones and temple area as well as my ears felt like they were going to pop out.
6247	103	7199	Jaxine from Nowhere, Fl	2012-01-21 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have been suffering from recurrent sinusitus for years now. I think it has been 5. I have about 5-6 infections a year, usually accompanied by a cold. I am in the middle of my first infection of the year, most likely caused by stress. I have been on a longer work schedule and doing quadruple the work. But this infection wasn't accompanied by a cold. It just came last night. I do the Neti Pot 2x a day everyday so I can prevent infection.

6249	103	7201	Lindsay  from Chicago, Il, Usa	2010-07-29 00:00:00	BETTER BUT NOT CURED	2	0	I have had severe nasal congestion due to allergies and repeated sinus infections since the age of 4. I spent years on allergy pills, medicated nasal sprays with HCl (the rebounding is terrible), and later saline sprays, which were far better than nothing but not that great. I started rinsing with a neti pot (1 cup of warm filtered water; 1/2 tsp of un-iodized salt; 1/4 tsp baking soda; and a few drops of castor oil for each nostril) about 3 years ago. It took a couple of weeks of using it daily or every other day before I noticed anything profound, but now I can breathe better -- particularly when I'm laying down for sleep -- than ever before in my life. If I'm sick I'll rinse 1-2 times per day; otherwise I only do it every other day. My nasal passages tend to keep draining little amounts for about half an hour after I rinse, so allow some time to sit upright with tissues on hand before going to bed. Important: When I only rinsed sporadically, it was not half as effective. If I do it less frequently than every other day, "stuff" has a chance to build up in my sinuses I have a noticeably harder time breathing.

The salt is very alkalizing and will remove the acids from the sinus area. The salt will also reduce the bacterial infection greatly and you should find relief if you do this 5-6 times a day.
6251	103	7203	Zuuch from London, United Kingdom	2008-06-02 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have used this technique to cure a really bad sinus infection. I just wanted to add that if you use green tea instead of just water its more effective. I also added a small amount of garlic juice and ginger juice to the tea . I made a half gallon of this solution and poured it all through. ( I just used a regular teapot because the neti pots are a bit small ) It took about half an hour. There was instant relief from pain and by the next day the sinus infection was cured just by this one treatment alone. I think the important thing is to get that garlic juice right up inside your sinuses onto the surface of the infected area. It stings a little, but not even as bad as chlorinated water.
6252	103	7204	Linda from Studio City, CA	2008-03-25 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Try using the Neti pot with warm salt water. It flushes out your sinuses like nobodies business and it's safe and effective. You can use it everyday. Whole Foods sells them or you can get them off the internet. This and the Cayanne pepper drink saved me last night. My sore throat went away and now my PND is getting better. You guys are great.

6254	103	7206	Rita from Pierson, FL	2007-11-29 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	NETI POT: Saw this remedy on Oprah and I tried it and no more antibiotics for me. This is an inexpensive ceramic pot (available in Health food stores)in which warm water and sea salt are mixed; you bend over sink and turn your head to once side. Keeping the pot level, place the small spout into the top nostril until it has a snug fit. breathe through your mouth and slowly tip you head downward allowing the warm water solution to travel through your sinuses and out the other nostril. You would not believe what will come out of there. This works for sinus infections, nasal congestion, post nasal drip and headaches. No more drugs or drops necessary. Can be used daily without any side effect.
6255	103	7207	Katia from Jacksonville, United States	2007-09-13 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I get a miserable sinus infection every year, usually it begins in August. A couple of years ago it started, after about three weeks, I went to the doctor and he gave me antibiotics and nasal spray. Ten days later I was no0 better off than when I started. Another, stronger antibiotic, another two weeks, same infection. Eight weeks and three drugs later I decided I was just going to have live this way forever. Then our accupuncturist neighbor came over one day and explained the neti pot process to me. A mild sea salt and warm water solution into the neti pot, tip your head back and slowly pour the salt solution into one nostril. This is where it gets tricky, because nature sends the salt water straight to your throat which will generally make you choke or cough in that position. You have to teach yourself to close off your throat (not breathe). Once you get a good bit of water in your nose, you roll your head backwards slowly and in the opposite direction. If the water is in the right nostril, roll left. You should be able to feel the solution running through your sinuses. Make sure you do this over a sink, or with a towel handy, because once the water makes it through, it will come out the opposite nostril, at which point you will likely sneeze or cough. I would repeat this step 4-5 times twice a day, ending with a good nose blowing. Salt dries things, even gooey sinuses. I never buy allergy meds any more, and before I could find a real neti pot, I mixed the salt and water in a glass and filled a straw with the solution. My kids find this process very entertaining as well, I usually have an audience when I treat my sinus infections.
6256	103	7208	MAHINDRA from DUBAI, UAE	2007-03-20 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Hi all. It may not be easy for everyone to buy a jalneti pot, coz it is not very easily available. A yoga institute in India taught me a better method, without using any pots. Take a cup (coffee mug size) of warm water (should not be too warm), add a pinch of salt and stir it. Now, try to hold some of this water in your palm (sufficient quantity) and quickly bring your left nostril close to it and try to suck that water with your left nostril, closing the right one with the right hand. As soon as you suck it take the right hand of your right nostril. All the water sucked in will come out either from your nostril or your mouth. Wait a bit, try it on the right side using the same technique and once done blow your nose gently from each side. Do it daily and say a big Good bye to your sinus issues.
6257	103	7209	Madeira from Alexandria, VA	2007-03-07 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I was suffering from a sinus infection and did not want to take antibiotics so after reading the H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide) remedies and the feedback, I decided to add about 7-8 drops of 3% H2O2 to my Neti-pot and rinse my sinuses out. I did this twice and also applied H2O2 to my cheek where my sinus was killing me. I then slept with a heating pad on my face and WA-LA -- no sinus infection -no pain the next morning! I could chew again!! Lots of disgusting stuff still coming out 2 days later but no antibiotics and no pain and in less than 24 hours -AMA-ZA-ZING!! This remedy is a keeper! Thanks for all who shared -- you gave me the courage to try it!!
6258	103	7210	Karena And Baird from Gainesville, FL	2007-03-04 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have cured my sinus infections by using a Netipot, which is a lavage treatment for your sinuses. But instead of just adding salt to the warm water, I also added 1/8 tsp. of a crushed clove of garlic. The garlic burns, but only for an instant. The garlic will zap the bacteria! I poured one pot of this into each nostril 2 times a day. My sinus infection was cured in 4 to 5 days. No, it is not a quick fix, but it does work!!
6259	103	7211	Penny from Glasgow, Scotland	2007-01-31 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I suffered with low grade sinus problems for years until I tried an ancient Indian yogic practice called Jala Neti, which involves using warm salt water to clear out the nasal sinuses. Yoga websites contain information on this procedure and links to suppliers of neti pots (little jugs specially designed for pouring the salt water through your nostrils). This is very different from spraying stuff up your nose, but is quickly learned and extremely simple, as long as you don't have a deviated septum or similar. Once you're in the habit, it takes about as long as cleaning your teeth. I now do this every day, more often if I can feel a problem developing with my sinuses, and for the first time in years have been able to breathe properly. I also haven't had a cold since I started jala neti about two years ago. The salt water clears bacteria, viruses, dust and assorted allergens out of your sinuses and nasal passages, and allows your nose to do its job properly. I would recommend this most highly, but would stress that you need a reputable source of information and products, and should never put anything except pure salt and warm water in the neti pot.
6260	103	7212	Jem from NYC, USA	2007-01-30 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I was desperate for a cure to my clogged sinuses and post nasal drip. Unable to take over the counter decongestants I searched high and low for a natural cure. I came across what is known as a neti pot which has been used by the yogis of India for centuries. It looks like a genie pot and you can buy it in any major pharmacy. There is one company who sells it along with little packets of solution which is more convenient but you can make your own solution using equal parts of salt and baking soda. You put the solution into the neti pot and fill it with warm *NOT HOT* water. The spout of the neti pot goes up one nostril, you tilt your head and the stream of warm water and solution comes out the other nostril. You then repeat the process on the other side, gently blowing your nose in between. The results for me were immediate but it can take a few days to get the mucous out. It really works, I have unclogged my sinuses and my post nasal drip is almost gone. You can use it every two hours but I suggest every other day. It can feel weird at first but it doesn't hurt and if you hold your head to the side properly, it will not go down your throat. If it burns a little it can mean that you either put too much salt or not enough in the water, you will have to play with the amount or buy the pre-made packets in the store. I just bought a refill of 40 packets for around ten bucks. This will draw all of the mucous out. I did not believe it but I was so desperate that I gave it a try. The nose is the number one source of viruses and bacteria because it is a filter. All colds and flu invade your body through your nose. By cleansing your sinuses every other day with a neti pot, you are removing viruses, bacteria, pollen and debris that can make you sick. It can be used to prevent getting sick as well as relieving the symptoms. I clean my sinuses with a neti pot before I brush my teeth and I do it every other day.
6261	103	7213	Eric  from Spring, Texas	2009-01-01 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	My son (7yrs old) had a really bad sinus infection that was causing a fever really bad snoring and over all discomfort. Had this 2 days. Over the counter meds would not work. He has had this before in the past and the doctor would prescribe anti bionics. Doctors have there place, but I'm sick and tired of the meds they push. We decided to take the natural route this time around. I searched the net, found this site. Ill keep this short, but I performed a sinus rinse on my son. I took a "Netti Pot" with a little over 8oz of warm distilled water. added 1 packet of the sodium stuff and 1 tbl spoon of Apple Cider Vinegar. His fever broke the same night and it appeared to knock his infection out. He sleeps much better now. I also have my son drink ACV...1 TBS with warm water and honey like a tea. Keep in mind, anytime you do a sinus rinse, use distilled water. If your child has sinus, allergy or asthma issues, I highly recommend a sinus rinse at least 3 days a week even if they are fine. Never use more that 1 tbl on a child for a rinse. Stings! I always test on myself before application for temp of water and sting factor of ACV. Add more water if you feel the sting is a bit much for your child. After doing this, we were able to get globs of bacteria ridden snot out of my child's nose. I know most of you will have hell doing a rinse on a child. My son is an avid swimmer. He also accompanies me when I spearfish in the salt waters of Baja Mexico. He's use to salt water, in and out of his nose. But I encourage you to keep trying. It does work. It is truly amazing to see something so common and available work so quickly. I was so impressed with the results, I had to post hoping this remedy can help others. If you have never used a Netti Pot. please follow the instructions thoroughly. Try it on yourself first to get the technique own. Most pots can be brought at a local convience store with a pharmacy section.Pots come with packets of sodium that I used. I also added the ACV for more potency. Based on my observation, the ACV was the key factor in the rinse. The sodium alone didn't have as dramatic an effect.

He has chronic allergies and sinus troubles from Sept-May and a nurse friend suggested this to me many years ago. It has worked wonders for my kids anytime allergies or congestion kick in. He went from not being able to breathe at all this morning, to breathing comfortably.

6264	104	7083	Heidi from Lake Stevens, WA	2006-07-06 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I've tried many of the remedies on your site (though not the inhaled ACV). All helped with my sinusitis to some degree, esp. the neti pot. Except hydrogen peroxide made the infection WORSE ... I think acidifying the nose helps, but making it more alkaline might make it worse for some people. I gave up dairy too, because that decidedly made things worse. Anyway, I still ended up on major antibiotics and steroids, though not as often. But what has worked consistently for me these days is a saline solution (as in the other posts) plus 3 drops of iodine solution per bottle of spray. Iodine kills anything, and it sinks into the skin. It's also very portable, so I can take my iodine solution on the plane or whatever. I imagine it might kill viruses that land in your nose after you've been next to a bunch of coughing people, though maybe that's just wishful thinking on my part. Iodine seems to promote skin healing (if the skin is unbroken), so maybe it makes the nose healthier too. So far, there has been no downside to using it twice a day. I sleep with no postnasal drip these days. Nice website, BTW!
6265	104	7084	Rita from Laurel Hill, NC	2006-03-25 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I am one that has been put on antibiotics since i was little for sinus infections. I tried this (1/4 teaspoon salt and warm water)just a few minutes ago and I already have results. My head isn't hurting as bad. Almost instant relief with just trying it one time. I have been pumping myself full of medicines today and this is the most relief that I have had in 2 days. The only thing now is that my ear is stopped up. But I can deal with that. If and when the pain comes back I'll do it again. Thanks for the remedy..
6266	104	7085	AS from Boston	2006-03-23 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I've had chronic sinus infections to the point where alot of antibiotics won't work any more for me. I remembered being a kid and any time I got a sore throat my dad would have me gargle w/salt and it always helped. So one day I was desperate the antibiotics weren't working (mind you I was being put on antibiotics at least 4 times a yr for sinus infections) so I broke down and got a large bowl (big enough i could fit my face into it) put in warm water and salt i then pulled the water/salt into my nose held it then blew it out into the sink I would do this until the water was gone or I was tired of doing it. I have had sinus infections in the last year and every time I did the salt mixture sometimes I'd have to do it once or twice a day for two or three days. It cleared up the infection and I didn't have to be put on antibiotics. Hope this might be of help to others as well!
6267	104	7086	Barbara	2006-01-11 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I learned this from an Aunt who had been dealing with sinus infections for years. It works for me too. I put a little salt in the palm of my hand, mix with warm water, plug one nostril and sniff the water & salt solution up. Repeat for the other nostril. It works.
6268	104	7087	Tish from Granger	2005-12-19 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Please, please, please add this recommendation: gargling with salt water and flushing your nose/sinuses out with salt water helps with sinus/allergy and headaches. Take 1/2 tsp salt and 8oz warm water. Gargle first then you can use a waterpic device from the drugstore, or get a little device like you use to suction out a babies nose. Fill with saltwater and shoot it up the nose. Don't inhale, just relax and let it go though the nasal cavity. This really relieved all my sinus/allergy problems (in addition to using acv.)

6270	104	7089	Diane from Foley, AL	2008-12-02 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I work with crafts nearly every day and more during the months of November and December working with fine glitter. That's when my sinuses start getting a little congested. When I am through with the work I walk into the bathroom wash my hands and then fill my hands with luke warm water and sniff the water into my sinus cavity and blow several times and Walla all clear. If I don't get to do it and an infection starts I use a few drops of peroxide and it's clear within 10 to 15 minutes. It took a couple of years to realize it was what I was working with that caused the problem. Yes, I wear a mask most of the time but that stuff just flies everywhere.
6271	104	7090	Greta from Hillsboro, Oregon	2007-10-25 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Yes, ice cream, cheese, milk and even unsweetened yogurt all cause me to have sinus infections--even raw goat milk. The raw goats milk was the least innocuous. There are times when none of these bothers me. At one time, about four years ago, if I drank milk (yes, even raw) I would choke on a huge volume of white mucus. I discovered that if your spleen isn't working properly milk can cause a huge mucus buildup. I went to work on my spleen and, lo and behold, I could drink milk once more without any ill effects. I also learned that allergies and sensitivities to foods are related to how much of that substance is stored in our bodies, and certain deficiencies (vitamin, mineral or enzyme) deficiencies we may have. Some allergies may be overcome within seconds of taking the substance you are lacking. For instance 'swimmer's ear' can be 'cured' by taking the EFA'S that person is lacking. Swimmer's ear usually occurs on a hot sunny day when one has been out too long in the sun and gotten a burn, effectively burning up precious EFA's. So, I think this may help people understand why they may be sensitive to a substance at one moment, and not another, or why two people may eat the same food, but only one becomes sick

I tried mixing 1/2 cup of Apple Cider Vinegar with 1/2 cup of water and heating it on the stove until it gave off a good amount of steam. I inhaled the steam with my mouth and eyes closed and it has helped tremendously after 2 treatments. I plan to keep doing this until all symptoms are completely gone. I also made the spicy tomato juice, garlic, and cayenne "tea" and I'm sure that helped also.
6273	104	7092	Kristen from Phoenix, Az	2009-10-11 00:00:00	BETTER BUT NOT CURED	2	0	I have had a severe sinus infection for at least 2 weeks, but have head sinus problems with congestion for at least 8 weeks. I've been on an antiobiotic for the last 10 days and I'm still miserable, but not as miserable. I tried the steaming with the apple cider vinegar about an hour ago. I used one cup of water and one cup of apple cider vinegar put it on the stove top and put my sweatshirt hood over my head to help catch more of the fumes. I'm not 100% but I'm definitely much clearer. I'm hoping it works as well as everyone has been saying and that I'll be feeling much better in the next few days doing this a few times a day. The fumes are strong and it makes your house stink, but I feel better. I also use a neti pot daily twice a day as a preventative measure, and since my sinuses have been so clogged I can only use it about 1/3 of the time. 2/3 of the time my sinuses are so clogged that the water can't come out the other nostril.

So when I got home from work I tried it and almost immediately the pressure in my sinus' was relieved. The next day all I had was a slight headached, but that was it! I am so excited and I would definetely recommend anyone who is suffering from this annoying problem to try it. Just 1 cup of ACV and 1 cup hot water boiled together. But definetely close your eyes and mouth it is a strong odor.

I took 2 treatments of antibotics and still felt horrible this morning. I decided to search for a home remedy. I was amazed by this website. I seen the info on drinking the acv but that didnt sound appetizing so when i seen the info on inhaling the vapors I went right to the kitchen and tried it. Within 20 minutes my ears where popped and now i have relief. I did it a second time and by this evening i am symptom free and feel like my self. I wish I had know sooner but i do believe it works. Thank you so much!

Had the flu for two   weeks previous, which progressed into a cold. Kept thinking I must be getting better soon.....then.. the outside of my nose became so sore it was as if I had been hit by something and I felt like I was getting another cold, but it was in my head, not body....Googled sinus infection and whala here sprang your website. Drank acv for a day with no results. Then steamed acv for about 5 minutes in the evening, and next morning. In short, I've steamed 3 times with acv and the bloody infection is almost gone. I can breath, my nose is about 75% less sore and I've stopped coughing. TRY THE STEAM, IT WORKS! And as others write, it hurts a little but who cares......think of it! A cure for a major time and life consuming ailment for about $3.00! Spread the word! Btw, there is a great old book on the wonders of Apple cider vinegar....don't know the name unfortunately.....but it's amazing curative powers are nothing new!

It recently got cold and started to snow so I figured that was the reason until I came across your site.The connection between ice cream and sinus problems came up. And what do you know just the night before and a few nights before actually I had been eating ice cream, Which I never eat but my roommate brought it home. I went and got ACV. I boiled it and inhaled it. I was so stuffed up I didn't even noticed or could tell the fumes were strong.Well after about 5 min after the inhaling was complete...The only word I can use to describe this action is Hocked.... I hocked up a good amount of phlegm through my throat.It was yellow and very thick. I can breath better but will still continue the treatment for the rest of the evening. Thanks for the tip.

Never having had one like this, I was miserable.. mostly from the severe headache, upper jaw pain and pressure. I did not want to go to the doctor, mostly because I knew he would just prescribe antibiotics (which I am against), and for the fact that I no longer have health insurance. I tried drinking 4 oz. of ACV mixed with 12 oz. of water. I noticed right away that my sinuses were clearer. But, unfortunately, my stomach became pretty upset. So I tried boiling the rest of my drink and inhaling the steam... boy, did that do the trick! My headache is almost gone and I can breathe through half of my nose!! I will continue the steam therapy throughout the day and look forward to more miraculous results! Thank you so much for this website! I can't wait to see how this helps my allergies, too! Bless you!

So I decided to boil water pour ACV in the boiled water, remove from heat and breath in with a towel over your head. This cured my Sinus infection completely I can't believe how quickly this worked. Thanks for the VALUBLE INFO!

I started breathing the steam from the ACV/water boil several times throughout the day. It immediately cleared my sinuses. I also drank the ACV with lemon juice and honey. I slept throughout the night breathing through my nose. Will repeat this remedy today. I'm almost feeling back to normal. I will tell everyone I know about apple cider vinegar cure for colds.
6283	104	7222	AJ from Bronx, New York	2005-11-23 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I tried inhaling ACV 1/2 cup water 1/2 cup ACV and I boiled it for a sinus infection. I placed a towel over my head to govern the fumes and did this twice a day for 3 days. I totally cleared my sinus infection. My doctor had prescribed me an antibiotic and that didn't work. I am glad I stumbled on this. And I didn't go to the organic store like most suggest, I just used the regular one out of the grocery store. Good Health!!!!
6284	104	7223	Abbie from Bronx, New York	2005-11-08 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I had this horrible sinus infection along with a lung infection. My pulmonary specialist put me on Amoxicillin and Allegra-D. This medication seemed to have made my symptoms of coughing and clogged sinuses worse. I was at the end of my rope until I stumbled on ACV. I am not big on mixing things and home remedies. I must admit I was skeptical about drinking the ACV and the right consistency. So I took a cup of ACV (Heinz brand from the local grocery store) and a cup of plain tap water and boiled it. I turned the fire off and closed my eyes and started to inhale it for approx. 5 minutes. I didn't try to overdo it nor did I become obsessive about it. And boy did it clear up all of the mucous. I continued to do this 2 times a day until it cleared. Thank you ACV. I was so tired of doctors making me sicker. I do believe that doing this with taking a vitamin C tablet has helped me tremendously. I hope this helps someone and I hope all of you feel better soon.

It works wonders for my sinus infections. I know the oil of thyme is used in things like mouthwash, so it might be as effective as the oregano, and the other herbs in it also have medicinal value. I use an organic herb mix.

I had such a sore throat that was working it's way into my right ear yesterday. I have had this since Monday and could barely stand it, so I looked up home remedies for sore throat and this website came up. I gargled once at 1pm yesterday and again at 7pm. I woke up this morning and it there was still just a small throb and pain so I gargled again this morning. By 11 am it was gone. I could swallow without pain in my throat or ear!
6287	104	7225	SojournTraveler from Plymouth, Michigan	2009-05-12 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Hi! Great site, I appreciate reading people's actual experiences. I go to ____ _____, a trance channeler like Edgar Cayce. For my question "How can I breath better?" I was told that I had a chronic sinus infection. The source advised me to put two to three tablespoons of sea salt into three cups of boiling water, place a towel over my head like a tent, and being careful not to burn myself to breath the steam for two to three minutes, for 9 days then twice a week thereafter. Worked perfectly. Since mucous needs salt to move, and salt can have antiseptic properties, it all makes sense. The other ideas, such as actually pouring a liquid through my sinuses, aren't attractive to me at all, although I acknowledge their effectiveness.

I breathed in the steam (with my eyes closed!) for about 10 minutes. The next day,I can't say I felt better, but "different". Every day after that I felt better and better, and after the 4th day I was no longer sick - at all. I mentioned this to a friend of mine who was sick and she got the same results I did - I will do this everytime I feel like I may be getting as cold or flu - it was amazing for me - and free, since I already had the oil in my medicine cabinet!
6290	105	7228	Randahl from San Jose, California	2008-04-10 00:00:00	WARNING!	6	0	For those looking to use Oil of Oregano for it's antimicrobial properties, I would like to specify that Oil of Oregano is NOT Oregano Essential oil, which would have to be diluted. If you're looking to buy this remedy, make sure that the ingredients list states that there is a carrier oil (like olive oil). Otherwise, be prepared to dilute it yourself, or there could be serious negative effects.
6291	105	7229	Riya from Bangalore, India	2008-03-30 00:00:00	NAY	1	0	I read about the remedy oil of oregano and purchased it from an online seller last year. This is really powerful stuff and I've been using it for my son's recurring viral infections with dramatic results. However, the oil actually made my sinus infection much worse. I thought the severity of my symptoms warranted around 8 drops a day under my tongue every 3-4 hours and continued the dose for 4 days. Every day I experienced a worsening of symptoms including asthma and stuffed nose with thick greenish-yellow discharge of mucous. I believe the oregano was responsible for it firstly, because the symptoms eased off when I stopped it and second, I read somewhere that yeast infections are typically exacerbated with good bacteria die-offs which is probably what the oregano was doing in those big doses. I wasn't eating enough yoghurt to compensate either. Just a note to everyone out there to be careful with overdoing the oregano oil. I'm doing far better with 2 cloves of garlic 5-6 times a day, lots of water, the homeopathic remedy arsenicum album 30X every 2-3 hours, and drastic reduction of refined carbs in my diet.
6292	105	7230	Aaron from Chicago, IL	2008-03-15 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	God and Oil of Oregano cured my sinus infection! Like many, one sinus infection after the other over the years. Tried, antibiotics, netti pot, homeopathics, echinacea, golden seal, tumeric, vitamin c, apple cider vinegar, acidophulus, gave up cheese and milk and other dairy items, gave up sugars. None of these did the job. Two weeks ago a cold turned into a sinus infection, with thick green and brown phlegm. On Saturday, the cold turned feverish. By 5:00 p.m, felt terrible, with a fever of 100. Online to do research. My wife, meanwhile, mentioned oil of oregano. I checked it out and discovered the Georgetown study, where it cured some drug resistant staph infections. Oil of oregano is believed to have both anti-bacterial and ant-viral properties. My wife had some in the cupboard. Decided to try it. Two drops under the tongue. Tasted terrible. Burned. Went to bed. Woke up at 6:00 p.m, an hour later, still felt terrible, but temperature had dropped to 99.1. Then, 30 minutes later, took temperature again, it was 98.6. Never in my life have I seen such immediate effects from anything. (But let's give God the credit, shall we? After all, it's God who makes the natural remedies in the first place. And it's God who directs us to the right cure at the right time. Let's always put God first and we'll always be the better for it.) Over the next 5 days, I increased the dosage to four drops under the tongue every 2-3 hours. Over those five days, the phlegm slowly changed from green and brown to clear. Sinus infection now gone completely. I would not have credited Oil of Oregano with the healing had it not been for seeing the immediate decrease in my temperature at those times. Nor would I have stuck with it when I did not see the same immediate results with the nasal secretions. But it handled it. I've continued a maintenance dose everyday since, of about five drops once a day. I recommend buying a bottle, but make sure it's wild oregano, and using it at the first sign of a cold or flu. One amazing remedy from Upstairs!
6293	105	7231	Renee from Los Angeles, CA	2007-11-12 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I came down with a most horrible sinus infection after getting a really bad head cold. I was desperate! I even went to a conventional pharmacy to ask for help- which of course, they couldn't do. So, I went to the health food store in my neighborhood and the lady there recommended wild oil of oregano. WOW! Is this stuff powerful! It is day 2 and the pain is completely gone and I can breathe freely. It is really hot (I take it sub-lingually) even though it is in an olive oil base. I have spent more money than I care to mention trying to find something that really worked- and this really does. I also irrigate my sinuses with a colloidal silver spray. The combination of these two things is the best I've found so far.

I will never touch the stuff again. . (Thanks!) I started seriously looking for natural cures when I lost sense of smell & taste due to clogged sinuses. The inhaled salt water & ACV steams helped with that, but it was the oil of oregano that finally got rid of the infection for good. A big thanks to the person who posted this remedy. I took four drops every 2 hours for about 4 days, then tapered down for the next 10 days. I started feeling better on day 2, but had it completely kicked by day 11. Thanks for this wonderful site.

Also have recently started taking Apple Cider Vinegar. Oregacyn completely cures sinus infections and completely reversed my son's asthma. ACV helps eradicate sinus stuffiness and itchy patches on the skin. I wanted to recommend a couple of other books that are definitely worth reading in your "Worth Reading" section: 1. The Cure is in the Cupboard by Cass Ingram. I love this book it is about oregano and it helped my son so much with his asthma. 2. The Fungus Link by Doug Kaufmann, I love his show-I am a faithful watcher every week day. I truly believe fungus is among us! 3. Beating Cancer with Nutrition by Patrick Quillin. This book was a wonderful guide to help my mother when she was battling lung cancer. The book outlines which foods can help our body heal from cancer during chemotherapy and radiation treatments, as well as which foods can help stave off chemo sickness during treatment. I love the nutritional aspect of improving the immune system. Thanks for your time. Love the website-I think I could become an addict to it!
6296	105	7234	Emily from Chandler, AZ	2006-12-20 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	organic oregano oil ( capsules size 00 ) 4 drops in capsule every 2 hours the first day and every 4 hours and then every 6 and then every 8 for a period of 10 days cures sinus infections. I have a friend that uses essential oils. I didn't have insurance at the time so i called her at my wits end. I normally am prescribed Zithromax and Prednisode ( a steroid) that's how severe my sinus infections normally are. You take it for 10 days and it fights off the infection. Also peppermint oil rubbed around your sinus area ( use a 1 to 1 ratio with cold pressed extra virgin olive oil) it gets your nose running right away. You do have to take it for 10 days or it can come back. Using this in combination to the other remedies on here will take care of the bacterial and viral sinus infections. (i get both!) Hope it helps. I've been doing this for the last 2 times i got a sinus infection.

If youve taken 1 or more rounds of antibiotics and they don't cure the sinus infection it usually means that the infection is fungal, not bacterial.When you take antibiotics they kill all the benificial baceria in your stomach and intestines which the Probiotics replenish. I started taking Probiotics and started feeling better the first day.
6299	105	7237	Lilianne from Corona, California	2011-08-14 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Just had to let people know about this supplement. I've had a chronic sinus infection for 3 weeks now. First I went to the doctor and got the usual antibiotics and was told to take zyrtec-d. After 10 days I felt no relief. My head, cheeks and jaw were pounding from the pressure. I started doing sinus rinses, acv, and purchased nature's rite sinus relief. After 5 days, I felt some relief but I still had pressure and lots of mucous coming out. I bought quercetin-bromelain from the vitamin shoppe for $25 because the worker said it worked really well so I figured why not? Omg, within the first half hour, I started breathing through my nose, my sense of smell was coming back, no mucous was coming out and absolutely no pressure. I was in heaven. Gonna take this on a daily basis. Did some research and it looks like this stuff is good for a whole bunch of other stuff. I can finally sleep at night!!

I have noticed that any product, especially ice cream with artificial flavors or colors produces the fake flu and sinus infection symptoms you describe.

6302	106	7201	Lindsay  from Chicago, Il, Usa	2010-07-29 00:00:00	BETTER BUT NOT CURED	2	0	I have had severe nasal congestion due to allergies and repeated sinus infections since the age of 4. I spent years on allergy pills, medicated nasal sprays with HCl (the rebounding is terrible), and later saline sprays, which were far better than nothing but not that great. I started rinsing with a neti pot (1 cup of warm filtered water; 1/2 tsp of un-iodized salt; 1/4 tsp baking soda; and a few drops of castor oil for each nostril) about 3 years ago. It took a couple of weeks of using it daily or every other day before I noticed anything profound, but now I can breathe better -- particularly when I'm laying down for sleep -- than ever before in my life. If I'm sick I'll rinse 1-2 times per day; otherwise I only do it every other day. My nasal passages tend to keep draining little amounts for about half an hour after I rinse, so allow some time to sit upright with tissues on hand before going to bed. Important: When I only rinsed sporadically, it was not half as effective. If I do it less frequently than every other day, "stuff" has a chance to build up in my sinuses I have a noticeably harder time breathing.
6303	106	7202	Ellen from Sherwood Park, Alberta, Canada	2009-11-26 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Try using a neti pot with celtic sea salt dissolved in a luke warm mixture. Use 1 tsp salt per cup of water. The salt is very alkalizing and will remove the acids from the sinus area. The salt will also reduce the bacterial infection greatly and you should find relief if you do this 5-6 times a day.
6304	106	7203	Zuuch from London, United Kingdom	2008-06-02 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have used this technique to cure a really bad sinus infection. I just wanted to add that if you use green tea instead of just water its more effective. I also added a small amount of garlic juice and ginger juice to the tea . I made a half gallon of this solution and poured it all through. ( I just used a regular teapot because the neti pots are a bit small ) It took about half an hour. There was instant relief from pain and by the next day the sinus infection was cured just by this one treatment alone. I think the important thing is to get that garlic juice right up inside your sinuses onto the surface of the infected area. It stings a little, but not even as bad as chlorinated water.
6305	106	7204	Linda from Studio City, CA	2008-03-25 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Try using the Neti pot with warm salt water. It flushes out your sinuses like nobodies business and it's safe and effective. You can use it everyday. Whole Foods sells them or you can get them off the internet. This and the Cayanne pepper drink saved me last night. My sore throat went away and now my PND is getting better.

6307	106	7206	Rita from Pierson, FL	2007-11-29 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	NETI POT: Saw this remedy on Oprah and I tried it and no more antibiotics for me. This is an inexpensive ceramic pot (available in Health food stores)in which warm water and sea salt are mixed; you bend over sink and turn your head to once side. Keeping the pot level, place the small spout into the top nostril until it has a snug fit. breathe through your mouth and slowly tip you head downward allowing the warm water solution to travel through your sinuses and out the other nostril. You would not believe what will come out of there. This works for sinus infections, nasal congestion, post nasal drip and headaches. No more drugs or drops necessary. Can be used daily without any side effect.
6308	106	7207	Katia from Jacksonville, United States	2007-09-13 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I get a miserable sinus infection every year, usually it begins in August. A couple of years ago it started, after about three weeks, I went to the doctor and he gave me antibiotics and nasal spray. Ten days later I was no0 better off than when I started. Another, stronger antibiotic, another two weeks, same infection. Eight weeks and three drugs later I decided I was just going to have live this way forever. Then our accupuncturist neighbor came over one day and explained the neti pot process to me. A mild sea salt and warm water solution into the neti pot, tip your head back and slowly pour the salt solution into one nostril. This is where it gets tricky, because nature sends the salt water straight to your throat which will generally make you choke or cough in that position. You have to teach yourself to close off your throat (not breathe). Once you get a good bit of water in your nose, you roll your head backwards slowly and in the opposite direction. If the water is in the right nostril, roll left. You should be able to feel the solution running through your sinuses. Make sure you do this over a sink, or with a towel handy, because once the water makes it through, it will come out the opposite nostril, at which point you will likely sneeze or cough. I would repeat this step 4-5 times twice a day, ending with a good nose blowing. Salt dries things, even gooey sinuses. I never buy allergy meds any more, and before I could find a real neti pot, I mixed the salt and water in a glass and filled a straw with the solution. My kids find this process very entertaining as well, I usually have an audience when I treat my sinus infections.
6309	106	7208	MAHINDRA from DUBAI, UAE	2007-03-20 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Hi all. It may not be easy for everyone to buy a jalneti pot, coz it is not very easily available. A yoga institute in India taught me a better method, without using any pots. Take a cup (coffee mug size) of warm water (should not be too warm), add a pinch of salt and stir it. Now, try to hold some of this water in your palm (sufficient quantity) and quickly bring your left nostril close to it and try to suck that water with your left nostril, closing the right one with the right hand. As soon as you suck it take the right hand of your right nostril. All the water sucked in will come out either from your nostril or your mouth. Wait a bit, try it on the right side using the same technique and once done blow your nose gently from each side. Do it daily and say a big Good bye to your sinus issues.

I did this twice and also applied H2O2 to my cheek where my sinus was killing me. I then slept with a heating pad on my face and WA-LA -- no sinus infection -no pain the next morning! I could chew again!! Lots of disgusting stuff still coming out 2 days later but no antibiotics and no pain and in less than 24 hours -AMA-ZA-ZING!! This remedy is a keeper!

6311	106	7210	Karena And Baird from Gainesville, FL	2007-03-04 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have cured my sinus infections by using a Netipot, which is a lavage treatment for your sinuses. But instead of just adding salt to the warm water, I also added 1/8 tsp. of a crushed clove of garlic. The garlic burns, but only for an instant. The garlic will zap the bacteria! I poured one pot of this into each nostril 2 times a day. My sinus infection was cured in 4 to 5 days. No, it is not a quick fix, but it does work!!
6312	106	7211	Penny from Glasgow, Scotland	2007-01-31 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I suffered with low grade sinus problems for years until I tried an ancient Indian yogic practice called Jala Neti, which involves using warm salt water to clear out the nasal sinuses. Yoga websites contain information on this procedure and links to suppliers of neti pots (little jugs specially designed for pouring the salt water through your nostrils). This is very different from spraying stuff up your nose, but is quickly learned and extremely simple, as long as you don't have a deviated septum or similar. Once you're in the habit, it takes about as long as cleaning your teeth. I now do this every day, more often if I can feel a problem developing with my sinuses, and for the first time in years have been able to breathe properly. I also haven't had a cold since I started jala neti about two years ago. The salt water clears bacteria, viruses, dust and assorted allergens out of your sinuses and nasal passages, and allows your nose to do its job properly. I would recommend this most highly, but would stress that you need a reputable source of information and products, and should never put anything except pure salt and warm water in the neti pot.
6313	106	7212	Jem from NYC, USA	2007-01-30 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I was desperate for a cure to my clogged sinuses and post nasal drip. Unable to take over the counter decongestants I searched high and low for a natural cure. I came across what is known as a neti pot which has been used by the yogis of India for centuries. It looks like a genie pot and you can buy it in any major pharmacy. There is one company who sells it along with little packets of solution which is more convenient but you can make your own solution using equal parts of salt and baking soda. You put the solution into the neti pot and fill it with warm *NOT HOT* water. The spout of the neti pot goes up one nostril, you tilt your head and the stream of warm water and solution comes out the other nostril. You then repeat the process on the other side, gently blowing your nose in between. The results for me were immediate but it can take a few days to get the mucous out. It really works, I have unclogged my sinuses and my post nasal drip is almost gone. You can use it every two hours but I suggest every other day. It can feel weird at first but it doesn't hurt and if you hold your head to the side properly, it will not go down your throat. If it burns a little it can mean that you either put too much salt or not enough in the water, you will have to play with the amount or buy the pre-made packets in the store. I just bought a refill of 40 packets for around ten bucks. This will draw all of the mucous out. I did not believe it but I was so desperate that I gave it a try. The nose is the number one source of viruses and bacteria because it is a filter. All colds and flu invade your body through your nose. By cleansing your sinuses every other day with a neti pot, you are removing viruses, bacteria, pollen and debris that can make you sick. It can be used to prevent getting sick as well as relieving the symptoms. I clean my sinuses with a neti pot before I brush my teeth and I do it every other day.

I found that if I kept this part of the head warm (wearing one and sometimes two caps on my head) the sinus problem would cease! You can also use a blow dryer to warm the head. I never had an actual sinus problem! My head infection was causing mucus to run down my sinus area.

Had his adenoids removed and was still on antibiotics, antihistamines, and a nasal steroid spray (all at the advice of his ENT) for the past year. I just decided to stop medicating my young son.....it was going on for WAY too long with no positive results. I'm wondering what dietary changes you have made that help with sinus problems. Maybe by looking at dietary changes, we can avoid the congestion in the first place.

I had sinus infections without stop for several years and we tried just about everything. Turns out that the sinusitis was being caused by GERD and a change in diet was called for. You can sure tell when I'm behaving myself and following a low-acid, low-fat, no-caffeine diet -- no sniffles. Let your readers know that they'd best be careful with some of the cures on this pages for just that reason. A number of the acids here could very well make a GERD patient worse (though I don't doubt that they work for folks with normal stomachs).

Also just corn tortillas will do it. I don't know if it is just all the altering of the corn to to enhance the growing process but something is wrong with corn now. Also, when something tends to be in everything...just the amounts that are consumed can create allergies to it. All I know is that Corn is one of my biggest factors in getting sinus infections and bronchitis. If it does go into my chest... Lymphomyosot by Heel is a good homeopatic remedy for it. I can alway clear up the bronchitis within 24 hours with it. Just take it every 20 minutes until you feel it getting better then do it 2 to 3 time day until well. I don't get bronchitis anymore since using it. I use to get bronchitis 2 to 3 times a year before.

I decided to follow Doug Kaufman's Phase 1 diet for a few months to see if that might make a difference. I have now been on this diet for a year this month. This has been the best winter for me ever, I'm 52 yrs old. I haven't had all the respiratory ailments that I normally experience every year. Just to test if the foods to avoid might be the culprit, I ate some off the diet at Christmas and the sinus came back. I took the herbs and supplements he suggests and it is all cleared up. I know now that my problem was fungus and all the antibiotics I've taken in the past, also sugar and corn was killing me.
6321	107	7246	Wendy from Brooklyn, NY	2007-02-12 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Years of constant sinus infections led me to many doctors and I was told to get surgery, which didn't help a lot. Finally an allergist suggested I cut out wheat; and it has been amazing! Though I still occasionally have a sinus flare-up it's been a HUGE difference and I now think that I didn't have as many infections as I thought, that I was having allergic reactions to wheat! I would advise anyone considering sinus surgery to try this first. I would not have gotten the surgery had I known.
6322	107	7247	Teresa from Waiuku, New Zealand	2008-06-04 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	For painful sinuses and the accompanying headache - beat 2 egg whites (stops them being slimy and difficult to handle). Spread out on a gauze (or cloth) and put over your face (avoiding eyes). Put another cloth over (optional). Lay down on your back and go to sleep. The heat/temperature will harden the gauze. Suggest you leave it on as long as you can. You will be pain free and as a bonus will get a facelift. I have used this remedy for migraines and hard to shift headaches and have always gained relief.

So I brewed a .50 oz of eucalyptus ( like you do coffee or tea in a coffee pot (12 cup) and then I put some sugar in, (optional) and drank that one time, and i felt the difference overnight, I then continued to drink a cup for the next couple of days to make sure that everything was cleared up.. I still make a pot of Eucalyptus tea. its great for cool nights and days, or refreshing on hot days.
6324	107	7249	Simon from Dubbo, Australia	2007-10-24 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	After getting a heavy bout of sinus infection / congestion I was keen to try the apple cider vinegar (with 'mother' in it). On Day One I consumed about three tablespoons at once and followed it with a chaser of flavoured water. The sinus seemed to get somewhat better, but I felt close to vomiting for a couple of hours after, and also had a headache, which I am not sure was just coincidental. I continued this for three days, one shot a day, but could not find any obvious improvement in my conditions. I then tried the tomato tea which was pleasant to drink, but didn't have any obvious effect on my sinuses. I then started putting eucalyptus oil on a clean handkerchief and continued sniffing this on a regular basis (up to once every couple of minutes). I would reapply eucalyptus oil to the handkerchief about four times a day. This really dried up the nasal passage and reduced the pressure in my sinuses. Of an evening I put the handkerchief near my pillow so the fumes are constantly being drawn into my nostrils as I sleep. I now use it on an as required basis and sniff it once or twice an hour if I feel sinuses building up. Eucalyptus oils are not all the same strength. The stronger the better.

As a result, I have not had the sore throat and stuffy nose that usually came with my colds AND they have not turned into an infection. I haven't had any antibiotics in 3 years. I recommended this to my sister in law who suffered from the same ailments and she swears by it too.

If you do it be careful not to get water in your ear/eustachian tube. If you get water in your ear use the "modified muncie technique" to get the water out. http://www.medhelp.org/user_journals/show/232... http://www.jaoa.org/content/108/5/260.full.pd... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatine_tonsil I have been doing the flip-turn multiple times daily for two weeks and have seen definite improvement: my brain fog and fatigue are almost gone, and my sense of smell has improved. I have tried various additives in the sinus rinse, including apple cider vinegar, hydrogen peroxide and Xylitol, as I strongly suspect that my problem is a fungal sinus infection.
6327	107	7252	Joyce from Kansas City, Mo	2013-08-15 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Just wanted to share my experience with garlic and my first sinus infection which included dental/jaw pain and headache on one side of my face. For two days I crushed a clove or two of non irradiated garlic (there's a green sprout inside) every two hours and mixed it with some honey for swallowing. I chased that with a glass of water with a couple drops of peppermint oil - this not only helps with flavor, but settles the stomach. I felt much better by day 3 and continued the garlic three times a day. I am on day 5 and still taking the garlic 3x/day. My symptoms are gone. I am still blowing out some yellow on that side and will continue the garlic until it's clear.
6328	107	7253	Dale from Durban, South Africa	2013-07-07 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I underwent 3 sinus operations for a continuous sinus infection. Antibiotics for almost 6 months, finally my ENT recommended I use Pulmicort in my sinus wash, which opened everything up but my sinuses continued to generate large amounts of gunk on a daily basis. In desperation, after reading the remedies on this website I tried crushing a fresh garlic, adding hot water and washing my sinuses with the solution. Very uncomfortable, but within 4 days the daily flood of sinus gunk stopped. 18 months later I developed a head cold, and the sinus problems started again. I had continued with the daily saline sinus washes in the interim, but started the garlic routine again and within 4 days my sinuses cleared.

Chop up a few garlic cloves and LET THEM SIT FOR 15 MIN. Pour boiling water OVER the cloves, and then dispose of the garlic. Add sea salt (I use the packets). Use this mixture in the neti pot once it cools. My sinuses were so irritated that the first treatment was... Uh, exhilerating... Almost painful. The second was much better. I did three treatments (no more than 2 a day) and I was 100% cured. Really could have stopped after the second treatment because I felt SO MUCH BETTER. From experience, the garlic worked for me.

6331	107	7170	Udarg from Boise, Idaho	2012-04-05 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I make a home preparation of a garlic solution by mashing 8 to 10 cloves of garlic and pouring just enough hot water over the top to cover and allow to stand for 2 days. I then strain out the garlic and add 1/2 to 1 teaspoonful of table salt to the mix and put the garlic-salt water into a small, clean vessel with a well fitted lid. When an infection is present I dip a Q-tip into the solution and carefully insert it into the affected sides nostril. I leave it in place until the person cannot stand it any longer. Once I remove the garlic saturated Q-tip I have them blow their nose. It doesn't take more than a few of these treatments to clear up a sinus infection. You will know it is clearing because the nasal mucus will begin losing the yellow or green color and begin to turn clear again.

6333	107	7172	Michelle from Albuquerque, NW	2007-01-09 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Fresh Garlic cured my Bronchitis and Sinus Infection. 1 finely diced clove (not the entire bulb) 3x's daily with any complimentary food that has been cooled almost to room temp (eg. diced tomatoes, avocado, chicken noodle soup, spaghetti sauce, pizza, or even apple pie.) Garlic is a natural antibiotic and antifungal. Within an hour or so, easier to breather and think, in 4 days cleared up symptoms. Took for 7 days to eliminate any chance of becoming ill again. Drawbacks: odiferous breath, and the odor also emanates from the pores of the skin. Use strong breath mints/cologne/essential oils to your liking.

For two weeks I have had much congestion and coughing..very aggravating to say the least. So I am happy to report that things are calming down! All ideas people post on here are worth trying and I am one of those people who will try most 'home remedies' before I will go to a doctor.

I had recently had a sinus infection and had already finished my round of antibiotics, but was still having a lot of drainage I could feel down the back of my throat. Last night, not feeling well, I went to bed early. I woke about 2 hours later and sniffed/coughed up a whole lot of very thick mucus several times. I immediately felt SO much better and the drainage down the back of my throat was gone. I have read several things through various websites of what coconut oil is good for and am anxious to see how it effects me through future use.

6340	108	7257	Dave from Fountain Inn, Sc	2013-05-18 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Concerning persistent sinus infections, all the posts above are enlightening and helpful. But if all else fails by all means don't forget to try colloidal silver. Over many years of fighting sinus problems I know this; when allergies strike and I'm getting stuffy, either a virus/fungus/bacteria is at work or the stuffiness will lead to an infection in short order. I get out my trusty colloidal silver (I make my own) and squirt some into both sinus cavities. One side will usually sting a bit. And poof. Stuffyness gone. Maybe one more application to both sinuses. Caught early enough I can knock out 90 percent of all infections immediately. The other 10 percent I have to keep re applying the colloidal silver over a day or two before being completely eliminated. I went from having four or five bad colds/broncial infections a year to none.
6341	108	7258	Dave from Charlotte, Nc	2012-10-04 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	If other remedies should fail, consider colloidal silver. My sinus congestion usually is due to infection and silver solution is easy to try. I put it in the palm of my hand, maybe a tablespoon full and sniff up sinus on both sides. Sometimes it sings more on one side. I re apply ten minutes later and more as needed if infection is persistent. I am prone to infections and this remedy has worked for me for over ten years.

Used it per instructions every 15 minutes it didn't seem to work for about 6 hours, then over the next 2 days I got better and better. Doc explained that silver was a germicidal agent that kills the bad bacteria, while body does the rest... interesting and would recommend to anyone, I have horrible sinuses and this stuff worked faster than antibiotics about 2-3 days total then keep sniffing it for about 1.5 weeks.. stop to soon and it comes back

Hi, I've been suffering with chronic sinus infections for about 4 years. Went to doctors several times, had an operation inside my nose and nothing worked. I am extremely mad a conventional medicine that uses drugs and surgery as treatment. Conventional medicine and drug companies should go down as they do more damage to the population than the diseases itself. After I got the operation, my life became a living hell. I lived my life around the sinus problems I had. I lost so many good things in live that I can't even count. I finally decided to take my health in my own hands and I will never go to a conventional doctor anymore, unless it if is a real emergency, in an ER of a hospital because one can't never say never, now I am my own doctor and I don't take drugs anymore. Why take drugs if they only purpose is to make money, IT IS ALWAYS ABOUT THE MONEY. The antibiotics destroyed my life completely. I gave tons of money to the drug companies on the course of this problem, I bought so many nasal decongestant and over the counter decongestants that if I have my money back I would probably be rich by now. I had relieved that came when I understood that most chronic sinus infections are fungal and not bacterial or viral. I started with the Threelac therapy, helped but, they don't tell you on the websites that you need to do a Candida diet for at list one month (very hard to do), then they send you a paper inside that tells you that you must do the diet, but I tried anyway, without the diet, it did not help. Then I did the Candida diet for 45 days, I felt fantastic, but all ended few weeks later, then I did colloidal silver maximum strength 10,000 PPM (parts per million) for 45 days, I felt fantastic again, but few weeks later the problem started again; this time I added Pro-biotic, PB8 14 million and used a water pump (the ones used for cleaning teeth) device with an end of rubber for nose use. I bought Organic sea salt and put two table spoons in 30 oz of distilled water, tilt my head about 45 degrees on top the sink and started the machine, all of the sudden there was a strong burning sensation,in my nose started some really loud noises inside and the discharge went on for about three days, I had to breed thorough the mouth for hours and when I got tired I used the decongestant to catch my breath a little, about few hours. My eyes burned too, to control this problem I used lots of cold water on my eyes and blinked. I did the same for several days and now I am nasal decongestant independent for about a week, and that is the first time in about 4 years. The real action was actually happened when I found the testimony of a lady on EARTH CLINIC ABOUT CREAM OF TARTAR. I went to the health store here in town and bought 10 spoons of the product for 9 bucks; the first time I drank one tea spoon of the product in a 4oz glass of water, I felt really strong reactions in my body. I was in and out the bathroom for two days, and was eliminating Candida like crazy. I check my ph the next morning, just before breakfast or brush my teeth, and it was a fantastic 7.5 ph, I am usually 6.0 ph, which is acid. I credit my cure to these five things together, 1) cream of tartar, 2) nasal pump 3) organic sea salt 4) pro-biotic and 5) Earth clinic, thank you. Ricardo Aguiar.

The pain in my tooth went away, so I didn't get it checked out. For the next year, every time I got sick, even a minor cold, I got this same major sinus infection. Finally after the year was up, I consulted a nutrionist about the causes of sinus infections. The first thing she mensioned was a bad tooth. I had forgotten about the tooth infection I had. Thank God, that same week, the tooth pain returned. I was determined to rid myself of thesr horrible sinus infections, so I went to the dentist and got my tooth pulled. That sinus infection lingered and lingered even after I got the tooth pulled, but that was the last one I ever had, and it has been almost a year now! I am so grateful something FINALLY worked for GOOD!!!

I have been miserable for 4 days and the antibiotic has given me no relief. I have been using steam, hot compresses, saline nose flushes. My cheeks and teeth and whole face so inflamed and painful. Well since nothing worked I thought I would try the opposite and got a flexible ice pack I had in the freezer. I rested it in all different places on my face and eyes. I can't believe how much better I am feeling. My swelling went down and I am breathing well too. I think my sinuses were so inflamed that the ice was just the trick I needed. I am sooo happy now.

6355	109	7272	Traci from Mesa, Az	2012-09-23 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	A vibrator works wonders to drain sinuses! Lying comfortably with your head propped up a bit, use a small handheld vibrator on your nose (the type that comes with multiple tips, I. E. For scalp, etc. I use the bulbous tip, but you could experiment), using the highest or most deeply vibrating setting your nose can stand. I start on the boniest part of the nose first and soon move to the cartiledge underneath that, following the "most tickle. " In other words, move the vibrator around from place to place (a few millimeters at a time), until you find the most ticklish spot. I press a bit, as this seems to help me find the ticklish spot. The most ticklish spot will move as the vibrations cause the sinus fluid to drain from one cavity to another. You might start to hear strange whirring and clicking sounds coming from your sinus cavities. I always do. Keep finding the most ticklish spot. After about twenty minutes, I start sneezing and the fluid starts draining. Once this starts you are well on your way! Go online and find a diagram of the sinuses. Try holding the vibrator on those sinus cavities on your face at the sides of your nose too. I have had success there. I have not had success with the cavities above the eyebrows, but do try there too. It is a slow process. It usually takes me an hour to complete a session. Sneeze, snort, swallow... , sneeze, snort, swallow... Etc. After about 25 sneezes, my sinuses are drained. What a relief.

I read an article about measuring your body ph and I had an extremely low in ph in by body which is acidic. I changed my diet and corrected my ph and my sinus infections went away. I get 1 or 2 a year but as long as I eat good and keep my ph in balance everything is ok. The first week of the diet I broke out with blotches all over my body and the doctor said it was detoxing from all the bad chemicals in my body.
6357	109	7274	007 from Jacksonville, Fl	2011-12-04 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Great info. So after an awful infection for 4 days I woke up with the worst pain and was about to go to Dr. to get antibiotics. Didn't want to take them so I decided to goggle home remedies and I had everything already (candida) so I drank some homemade water kefir, took a dose of OOO (Olive leaf oil/ oregano oil) straight with kefir to wash it down. And made a homemade salad dressing for my salad. I used virgin olive oil, _____ liquid amino, a lot of _____ ACV, one pack of stevia, cayenne pepper, salt, garlic powder, a garlic clove diced up and some dried oregano. I ate my salad with my homemade dressing and drank my kefir and within one hour I felt great. Headache gone, balance back, swollen sinus pressure gone, and it doesn't hurt to breathe. I didn't want to believe it would work so quickly but it did. So ACV, water Kefir, and OOO (Olive of oregano/olive leaf oil) gets three thumbs up. I will continue treatment for several days.

6359	109	7189	Michelle Cheri from Los Angeles, Ca	2010-09-21 00:00:00	QUESTION	7	0	Hi all! So, I have had sinus issues for 10 years or so, and have been dizzy (not vertigo, already went to an ear doctor for a test, my inner ear is fine) for an entire year. The doc did a CT scan and said I have significant sinusitis (also I have acid reflux). I do NOT want to do antibiotics, so I tried all the remedies here: oil pulling (sesame) 2x/day, hydrogen peroxide/sea salt/baking soda rinse in my SinuRinse nedi med bottle 2 or 3x/day (8oz filtered water, 1/2 teaspoon b. S. , 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1 1/2 TB h. P. ), ACV/water mix 2x/day (2-3 TB), steam inhalations w/ eucalyptus 1-2x/day, humidifier at night, and taking all the herbs recommended for sinus echinacea 3x/day, diet of no dairy no wheat no refined sugar no meat only veggies (lots of onion and garlic) fruit nuts and beans, hot tea, no caffeine or alcohol... I mean I'm doin it all here. The weird part is I havent had any pain (knock on wood) just stuffiness and dizziness all the time and I saw the ct scan pics and how much mucous there is in my maxillary sinus cavity. I have been doing all this for 5 days. My stuffiness is kind of subsiding, but comes and goes and the sinus rinse seems to make me more stuffier later. Still dizzy. Don't get a ton of mucous coming out of me when I do all this, maybe just a little, so my sinus cavity doesnt seem to be draining... And I'm not experiencing any detox effects. My questions are has anyone heard of dizziness being a symptom of sinusitis? and why isn't any of this working? PLUS when I oil pull, after 20 minutes the oil is still yellow while of course also being thicker and stuff, but isn't it supposed to be white? I also have a hard time not swallowing a bit of it while its in my mouth, does that happen to any of you? please help

Tried the ACV in a drink with raw honey, and mixed with my salt water for the neti pot for several days now. Doesn't seem to help much. Also tried H2O2 in my neti pot last night and today - that burned like crazy, and I got LOTS of stuff out. However, it seems to cause a huge rebound effect in my infection. Any other suggestions? Thanks in advance.
6361	109	7191	Elizabeth from Nashville, Tn	2009-09-11 00:00:00	NAY	1	0	Nasal Fungal Infection? I have had nasal issues for the past couple of years since I have had septoplasty done. Since the surgery, I have had alot of post nasal drippage and a "smell" coming from my right nostril. Now, I am self treating for systemic candida so I am almost certain this is stemming from that. I have tried using 50/50 peroxide spray, tea tree oil spray, 50/50 ACV spray etc.. and have not had luck. Does anyone have any suggestions on the best way to get rid of this? My main complaints are stuffiness (like my nasal cavity is swollen and itchy) and nasal drip (which is stinky!!) and constantly blowing nose. Sorry, don't want to gross anyone out. I'm going crazy here!!!!
6362	109	7192	Bill Julian from Brockton, Mass	2009-03-03 00:00:00	NAY	1	0	I have chronic sinus infection, I have it now and have had it for about 30 days. Just can't shake it. I am on ACV, GSE, Nasal pot, vit c 2000mg/day,garlic pills, trying to drink plenty of water each day, inhaling ACV as well. I have some relief but the pain the head is there, comes and goes, worse at night. I am leaving for India in 3 day and am desperate to find a cure. The cure may come but I need to see more improvement. I have read so many posts by so many good people giving there solutions and their experiences. I guess I will just continue what I am doing. I will not go to a doctor to take antibiotics they don't work for me. Well, thanks for allowing me to vent and when I find a cure or something that has really made the difference with these chronic horrible sinuse problems I will post it. Bill
6363	109	7193	Mary from Chesapeake, VA	2009-02-15 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	This has been the most effective cure for congestion and sinus infection I have found to date. Use a saline wash (Neti Pot) with 1/4 teaspoom of non-idodized salt + 1/8 teaspoon of powdered grapefruit seed extract (found in vitamin/health store). Chew two cloves of garlic twice daily. It helps to drain the sinuses. Garlic contains Allicin, a broad spectrum antibiotic. It's antiviral and antibacterial, as well as anti-microbial. Drink mugs of steaming hot chicken soup. It's comforting and hydrating and helps to loosen mucous. Take a teaspoonful of honey before bed to soothe sore throat and reduce coughing. This is amazing--something that tastes great and really works! Eat two-three oranges or tangerines daily. Keep up your circulation by walking lightly daily (20 minutes) at the tail end of your cold. Increased circulation boosts the immune system and stimulates the lymph nodes to produce the killer white blood cells. Drink a healthful smoothie of pineapple juice, strawberries and blueberries to strengthen your immune system. DO NOT eat anything fatty or fried foods that could plug up your digestive system. If you cramp up and get constipated you slow down your recovery from a cold or sinus infection.
6364	109	7194	D. from Atl, GA	2008-07-19 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I think the ACV is great for thinning mucous of a sinus infection,but it hasn't worked well for an infection that has been going on for a number of days. I just got back from an 8 day trip and the plane (going and coming) reaked havoc on my congested sinus passages. While I was out of town, I stopped by a Whole Foods and got some acv to take. I kept my pH alkaline by sipping some acv in a water bottle every 5-10 minutes. It certainly made my nose run! I also squirted 3% hydrogen peroxide from a nasal spray bottle up each nostril... just one squirt. It burned like crazy for a minute, but definitely helped. When things got stirred up again after flying home, I decided to up my water intake (One glass of water every 2 hours), take oregano oil (to fight the infection), and one turmeric capsule (to reduce inflammation). The wild oregano oil turned my thick yellow mucous to clear in about an hour. I will continue all of this (lots of water, turmeric, oregano oil, acv) until the infection is gone. Lot of hard work to clobber the infection, but better than antibiotics. Which isn't to say I would refuse antibiotics if I really needed them! But if I don't have to, I don't.

I am 35 and still have my wisdom teeth, and agree with the person on here that said they think there is a connection between wisdom teeth and sinus pressure and infections. Anyway I wanted to suggest to everyone on here to try the greatest sinus remedy of all it is called Cyclone Cider and is available at major health food store chains. It is a mixture of apple cider vinegar, cayenne pepper, garlic horseradish root, ginger root, vitamin c, onion and parsley SO ALL bases are covered. It is a little pricey BUT worth it because I have not been able to duplicate its snappy tom type flavor myself. It works wonders and can be used in food, with apple juice of alone!

I emptied a little nasal spray bottle to put my own concoction. I filled it about 1/3 of the way with water-added about 1/8 tsp. salt, one drop of oil of oregano, and one drop of Apple Cider Vinegar. I spray this up my nose several times a day. In two days, my sinuses and cleared up!
6367	109	7197	Kimber from North Illinois	2013-05-17 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	After 2 week of dealing with severe spring allergies which consisted of major head/ sinus congestion, watery eyes, and coughing from post nasal drip I felt maybe maybe a trip to the doctor might be a next step. I was taking a decongestant, a antihistamine , netti pot, and Apple Cider Vinegar 2x's per day, with all this I was feeling like a sinus infection was brewing- adding pressure and headache. So to get to the point- I hate going to the doctor and trying to handle this the best way I knew how. Desperate to get rid of this brewing sinus infection I took 1 tablespoon of Apple Cider Vinegar and added to the netti pot with warm water. After completing only 1/2 the treatment because it was very uncomfortable burning through my sinus cavity I had to stop. Well be prepared- w/ a box of Kleenex because war had been declared!!! With in minutes stuff/ infection was on its way out. Within an hour relief was being felt. As uncomfortable as the neti pot was with Apple Cider Vinegar the result were quick and immediate. Bye bye infection!

I have about 5-6 infections a year, usually accompanied by a cold. I am in the middle of my first infection of the year, most likely caused by stress. I have been on a longer work schedule and doing quadruple the work. But this infection wasn't accompanied by a cold. It just came last night. I do the Neti Pot 2x a day everyday so I can prevent infection.

6372	110	7241	Diane from Los Angeles, Cal.	2013-02-01 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I suffered from sinusitius for about 10 years and in my case I discovered that I didn't have a sinus problem but some sort of infection at the back of my head just below the crown. When I got a sinus attack I could feel that the back of my head was ice cold! I found that if I kept this part of the head warm (wearing one and sometimes two caps on my head) the sinus problem would cease! You can also use a blow dryer to warm the head. I never had an actual sinus problem! My head infection was causing mucus to run down my sinus area.
6373	110	7242	Jaenfjfi from Omaha, Nebraska	2009-09-04 00:00:00	BETTER BUT NOT CURED	2	0	I have been using 1/2 tsp. of ACV with 1/2 cup of apple juice twice a day for my 5 year old son (he weighs 44 lbs)and it has helped after about a week (although he did have loose stools because he doesn't usually drink juice) He has struggled with sinus infections for the past two years. Had his adenoids removed and was still on antibiotics, antihistamines, and a nasal steroid spray (all at the advice of his ENT) for the past year. I just decided to stop medicating my young son.....it was going on for WAY too long with no positive results. I'm wondering what dietary changes you have made that help with sinus problems. Maybe by looking at dietary changes, we can avoid the congestion in the first place.

Just wasn't going away and getting worse. I went to the doctor and she said I can't prescribe anything because it's not strep (thank goodness cause I HATE antibiotics). Now what? I'm sick and tired of this pain!
6374	110	7243	Anonymous	2007-12-13 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Dietary change can be a very good way to remedy sinus infections -- but make sure your readers know that what they might have cured with the diet change was more than the sinusitis itself. I had sinus infections without stop for several years and we tried just about everything. Turns out that the sinusitis was being caused by GERD and a change in diet was called for. You can sure tell when I'm behaving myself and following a low-acid, low-fat, no-caffeine diet -- no sniffles. Let your readers know that they'd best be careful with some of the cures on this pages for just that reason. A number of the acids here could very well make a GERD patient worse (though I don't doubt that they work for folks with normal stomachs).
6375	110	7244	Diana from San Diego, CA	2007-09-27 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have found that if I eat anything with corn in it I will get a sinus infection I have alway thought it was the high frutose corn syrup because if I eat or drink anything with the corn syrup in it I get sinus infections. Also just corn tortillas will do it. I don't know if it is just all the altering of the corn to to enhance the growing process but something is wrong with corn now. Also, when something tends to be in everything...just the amounts that are consumed can create allergies to it. All I know is that Corn is one of my biggest factors in getting sinus infections and bronchitis. If it does go into my chest... Lymphomyosot by Heel is a good homeopatic remedy for it. I can alway clear up the bronchitis within 24 hours with it. Just take it every 20 minutes until you feel it getting better then do it 2 to 3 time day until well. I don't get bronchitis anymore since using it. I use to get bronchitis 2 to 3 times a year before.

I decided to follow Doug Kaufman's Phase 1 diet for a few months to see if that might make a difference. I have now been on this diet for a year this month. This has been the best winter for me ever, I'm 52 yrs old. I haven't had all the respiratory ailments that I normally experience every year. Just to test if the foods to avoid might be the culprit, I ate some off the diet at Christmas and the sinus came back. I took the herbs and supplements he suggests and it is all cleared up. I know now that my problem was fungus and all the antibiotics I've taken in the past, also sugar and corn was killing me.
6377	110	7246	Wendy from Brooklyn, NY	2007-02-12 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Years of constant sinus infections led me to many doctors and I was told to get surgery, which didn't help a lot. Finally an allergist suggested I cut out wheat; and it has been amazing! Though I still occasionally have a sinus flare-up it's been a HUGE difference and I now think that I didn't have as many infections as I thought, that I was having allergic reactions to wheat! I would advise anyone considering sinus surgery to try this first. I would not have gotten the surgery had I known.
6378	110	7247	Teresa from Waiuku, New Zealand	2008-06-04 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	For painful sinuses and the accompanying headache - beat 2 egg whites (stops them being slimy and difficult to handle). Spread out on a gauze (or cloth) and put over your face (avoiding eyes). Put another cloth over (optional). Lay down on your back and go to sleep. The heat/temperature will harden the gauze. Suggest you leave it on as long as you can. You will be pain free and as a bonus will get a facelift. I have used this remedy for migraines and hard to shift headaches and have always gained relief.

So I brewed a .50 oz of eucalyptus ( like you do coffee or tea in a coffee pot (12 cup) and then I put some sugar in, (optional) and drank that one time, and i felt the difference overnight, I then continued to drink a cup for the next couple of days to make sure that everything was cleared up.. I still make a pot of Eucalyptus tea. its great for cool nights and days, or refreshing on hot days.
6380	110	7249	Simon from Dubbo, Australia	2007-10-24 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	After getting a heavy bout of sinus infection / congestion I was keen to try the apple cider vinegar (with 'mother' in it). On Day One I consumed about three tablespoons at once and followed it with a chaser of flavoured water. The sinus seemed to get somewhat better, but I felt close to vomiting for a couple of hours after, and also had a headache, which I am not sure was just coincidental. I continued this for three days, one shot a day, but could not find any obvious improvement in my conditions. I then tried the tomato tea which was pleasant to drink, but didn't have any obvious effect on my sinuses. I then started putting eucalyptus oil on a clean handkerchief and continued sniffing this on a regular basis (up to once every couple of minutes). I would reapply eucalyptus oil to the handkerchief about four times a day. This really dried up the nasal passage and reduced the pressure in my sinuses. Of an evening I put the handkerchief near my pillow so the fumes are constantly being drawn into my nostrils as I sleep. I now use it on an as required basis and sniff it once or twice an hour if I feel sinuses building up. Eucalyptus oils are not all the same strength. The stronger the better.

As a result, I have not had the sore throat and stuffy nose that usually came with my colds AND they have not turned into an infection. I haven't had any antibiotics in 3 years. I recommended this to my sister in law who suffered from the same ailments and she swears by it too.

If you do it be careful not to get water in your ear/eustachian tube. If you get water in your ear use the "modified muncie technique" to get the water out. http://www.medhelp.org/user_journals/show/232... http://www.jaoa.org/content/108/5/260.full.pd... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatine_tonsil I have been doing the flip-turn multiple times daily for two weeks and have seen definite improvement: my brain fog and fatigue are almost gone, and my sense of smell has improved. I have tried various additives in the sinus rinse, including apple cider vinegar, hydrogen peroxide and Xylitol, as I strongly suspect that my problem is a fungal sinus infection.

For two days I crushed a clove or two of non irradiated garlic (there's a green sprout inside) every two hours and mixed it with some honey for swallowing. I chased that with a glass of water with a couple drops of peppermint oil - this not only helps with flavor, but settles the stomach. I felt much better by day 3 and continued the garlic three times a day. I am on day 5 and still taking the garlic 3x/day. My symptoms are gone. I am still blowing out some yellow on that side and will continue the garlic until it's clear.

Antibiotics for almost 6 months, finally my ENT recommended I use Pulmicort in my sinus wash, which opened everything up but my sinuses continued to generate large amounts of gunk on a daily basis. In desperation, after reading the remedies on this website I tried crushing a fresh garlic, adding hot water and washing my sinuses with the solution. Very uncomfortable, but within 4 days the daily flood of sinus gunk stopped. 18 months later I developed a head cold, and the sinus problems started again. I had continued with the daily saline sinus washes in the interim, but started the garlic routine again and within 4 days my sinuses cleared.
6385	111	7276	Hope from Inverness, FL	2008-06-10 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	The best way to get rid of a sore throat is to drink fresh carrot juice (as much as possible) and within a day or two, it should be gone. You can buy it at your local health store or juice the carrots yourself if you have a juicer. The problem with this, however, is it can be costly and time consuming (if you are using a juicer). So here is another option that I do a lot (and also use it for my daughter). I use a homeopathic "cold remedy". You can buy it at your local health store or buy it online. You have to follow the instructions just like it says. Sometimes, you have to take the "pill" once every 2 hours and sometimes it will be once every 15 minutes until it subsides... and then an hour or two thereafter till it goes away.  For me, the homeopathic cold remedy works usually within 2 days... but again, you need to be religious about taking the pills.

It felt like there was broken glass in there, and I could barely swallow my own saliva. In desperation (because I have another rehearsal tonight! ), I found this site and ran down to the kitchen to try it. After gargling a cup of warm water with 1 tsp. Cayenne and 1/2 tsp. Sea salt, I felt so much better I went back to sleep. When I woke up a few hours later, my sore throat was 85% gone so I gargled again, and it's pretty much entirely gone now. I'm going to gargle with cayenne water after every strenuous rehearsal from now on! Thanks so much!

I tried the whiskey and that numbed my throat but it didn't cure it, and I didn't want to repeat it because even with the gargle, I found it went in through my mouth's pores (slight buzz). So I tried gargling the cayenne, but I really think that the drinking of the cayenne was the best. I ended up putting it in my water bottle and drinking it throughout the day. What it did best was open my throat temporarily and clear my sinuses. As the post-nasal drip disappeared, so did the sore throat. It also helped as I was teaching too. I was able to be my normal volume without losing my voice. Started drinking it Wednesday night and through Friday, by the time of the gig, I was great! Oh, and the name-brand stuff worked just fine for me.

I woke up two days ago with a sore throat and as my day at work went on it kept getting worse. It would also be my 5th sore throat this summer, which I had taken a lot of antibiotics for. But the second I got home from work, I looked on the internet for any cures, and stumbled upon this. I felt it was my last option.

6397	111	7288	David C from Melbourne, Australia	2011-08-22 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Just tried this today and it worked almost instantly! Just get a cup (250ml) of orange juice with pulp and mix it well with about 1/8th of a teaspoon of Cayenne and sip it slowly.

I had been suffering with a horrible raw sore throat for four days solid, and tried salt water gargles, cough drops, sore throat spray, cold medicines, nothing was working! Then I found this site and the overwhelming recommendations for cayenne. So I heated up some broth and added some cayenne and drank it. It worked great!! I instantly started feeling better!! I brought some with me to work to drink throughout the day yesterday and I feel soooo much better! I'm almost 100% now, after just one day! Thank you for this great tip!

Ok, here's the story --- a little more than 2 weeks ago I went to a bohemian style restaurant that served Hookahs... Having never tried it, I ordered one and began to puff away the entire evening.... Very cool.... However 3 days later I woke up with a terrible sore throat and congestion... (beware of the public hookahs!!!!!! They are FUNK harbingers!!! ).... I gargled with mouthwash many times, and salt water also, and nothing got rid of it.... It has lasted a full two weeks and I was at my wits end and even considering going to the Doc which I never do... But last night I googled and found this site... I immediately went to the kitchen and found that I did not have any cayenne pepper... However I did have a shaker of "Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning" which lists red pepper (cayenne) as one of its main ingrediants... So I got a coffee mug and shook a good amount of it into the mug and even threw in some salt on top... Then I just filled it with tap water and stirred..... Then I began to take small swigs and gargled them.... I never actually drank any outright but I did swallow the spit I had which was heavily laced with the salty peppery concoction.... After I got thru the whole mug I went and got a spoon full of honey and slowly swallowed it to coat my throat... Then I went to bed... This morning a woke up and guess what.... NO sore throat... Its completely gone... Many many thanks for the remedy... it realy works!!!!!

I finished one round of antibiotics and the symptoms instantly came back. The doctor prescribed a different antibiotic. When my throat infection started to come back after completeing that, she informed me if this didn't work she'd have to send me to an infectious disease specialist.

6403	111	7294	Thatsmyboys from Lake Charles, La	2011-04-12 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I used a little over 1/8 tsp in 1 cup of warm water to gargle when I noticed white spots on the back of my throat of course the throat pain was the dead give away. I gargled (not swallowing) in small sips the entire cup, it burned a little (not enough where I couldnt stand it). I did a second cup of the same repeating, 30 min after first gargle, already the pain is subsiding and I can swallow without tears! Thanks..

6405	111	7201	Lindsay  from Chicago, Il, Usa	2011-03-10 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I cannot believe how fast this cure worked. I had a sore, very swollen throat while traveling overseas, I was prescribed some Augmentin (antibiotic) and within a few days it went away. The problem arose when I relapsed after I got home and had no more antibiotics. My regular sore throat cure of gargling with ACV in warm water didn't seem to help, though it has cured every other sore throat I've had in the last 15 years. It hurt to swollow my own saliva when I started gargling with the cayenne pepper (1 tsp in 16 oz of warm water). It didn't seem to help much after just the first glass, but after three in 24 hours, almost all symptoms were gone. It worked much faster than the Augmentin the doctor prescribed, and the sore throat stayed away this time (a month has now passed). I also support other reviewers' suggestion to put on chapstick first. I expected the unpleasant burning sensation to be much stronger than it was, but it was mostly just on my lips when I didn't use chapstick.

I can't believe that I didn't think about it for a sore throat. I am mixing up a cold apple juice with cayenne now. Cayenne pepper can be put into coffee or tea. It's really a great thing!! Thanks!!
6407	111	7297	Ln  from Portland, Or, Usa	2011-02-10 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I don't normally get bad sore throats, but after six days of relentless pain and increasing loss of sleep, I knew I had a problem. My usual tricks of honey/lemon/hot water and raw garlic did not cure as usual. I worried I had the dreaded strep throat, and loathed to take antibiotics. On the verge of calling my physician, I did one last search on alternative cures for strep and landed at Earth Clinic's site. I immediately took 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne in 8 oz of warm water and began to gargle. I repeated 15 minutes later, and then every couple of hours. I found I needed to swallow just a bit to get to the pain deep in my throat. The relief was gradual for me, but after 24 hours, the pain was almost completely gone! I am still amazed by my rapid recovery: I went from feeling that the pain would never subside to back to work and cheerful in 24 hours. Incredible! I will remember this remedy for myself and my family, and come back to this site often. Thanks to all for sharing your stories. I find these personal testimonies reassuring and extremely helpful.

I gargled with the cayanne and I instantly felt better, I was even getting white bumps on my throat, and they went away. I was so amazed. A few months later, my coworker could barely talk, she said she wanted to cry it hurt so bad I got her a hot glass of water and put cayanne pepper in it and told her to gargle it. The next day her voice was back and it felt all better. This is truly amazing I am so glad I found this, so I can recommend it to my family and friends so they will now how to heal themselves naturally also!

I tried drinking asv/lemon/honey very soothing but with no obvious results. I came on earthclinic and read about cayenne pepper. WOW!! ONE gargle and the pain was gone!! I really have never seen anything work so quickly as this. Today still no sore throat but the chest congestion became painful. I decided to continue to trust in the cayenne so I poured a glass of juice and added two sprinkle of pepper and drank it this time. Another WOW! All of the discomfort went away. I now have a 99.9 fever that I learned after reading that the cayenne warms up the body as it is healing. AWESOME! Thank you all for sharing!!

I found this site and the cayenne pepper recommendation and was willing to try anything... But doubted it would work. I never post, but felt I had to as this worked AMAZINGLY! I felt relief after the first gargle (6 oz very warm water/ 1/4 tsp cayenne). Repeated every 15 min to half hour for a few hours and the pain is almost totally gone. I am so happy to have found this secret recipe. Thank you!

Nothing would help and then when I tried the cayenne pepper thing it got a lot better almost immediately! This is what I did: First I gargled with Cayenne Pepper and warm water and then right afterwards gargled with salt and warm water and then washed it all down with water. I did that two times. About half an hour ago I was almost crying my throat hurt so much and now it only hurts a little. It is certainly worth doing because it really works! I would really suggest it! Teslin

I have had a seriously congested nose & head for a week with a sore throat. Last night I made a big dish of spaghetti with sauce. I sprinkled a load of cayenne peper on it. This morning I was so much better. Honestly!! I feel better! I now have a bit of a cough but it's productive. I had more spaghettie with cayenne for lunch, coughed a lot but am doing much better overall! I had tried all sorts of meds and nothing was touching this.
6414	111	7304	Sarah from Palmdale, Ca	2010-04-16 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I had the worst sore throat I'd ever experienced for six days. After trying throat sprays, lozenges of many kinds, tea, hot water, gargling with salt, etc. I had given up and was wondering if I would ever get relief (and some sleep!) I mixed 1 teaspoon of cayenne with 8 oz. of hot water, put some chapstick on my lips (as others said it would help...and it did) and gargled with the concoction. Like many others I swallowed a bit, because I couldn't get it deep into my throat by gargling. I tried this twice for about 30 seconds each gargle, then waited 15 minutes and gargled again. I'm not cured, but I feel 90% better. At a minimum, I know I will get some sleep tonight. I will keep gargling and hopefully be better soon!

6416	111	7306	Ynos420  from Lakewood, Ca, Usa	2010-04-03 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Hello...I just wanted to let you all know that Cayenne Pepper works great! I had a really bad sore throat. It was so bad that it hurt even to swallow my own saliva! I went to the doctor thinking that I would get some relief! I saw the doctor and she told me that it was a viral sore throat and prescribed me a pain killer that I could gargle with. I tried it and it worked, but not well enough to where I was at least able to drink water. After becoming increasingly irritated that not only was the trip to the doctor a waste of time, but so was the perscription. I started getting desperate for some sort of relief. So I did a google search for "best cure for a viral sore throat", and this site came up as the first result. There were an overwhelming 325 positive responses to this treatment. I figured I am willing to do ANYTHING to get some sort of relief. I went down to the local store and purchased Cayenne pepper for $.79. Got home got a cup of warm water and a teaspoon of the pepper, gargled twice, it was really spicy, but not unbearable (but it still no worse than having the sore throat). Afterward I immediatley felt better!

I put vaseline on my lips to coat them to avoid the burn then I mixed lemon juice in maple syrup( master cleanse) with as much cayenne pepper as I could stand and started drinking it throughout the day. Wow I felt so much better I could sleep in peace

Cayenne Pepper is the best! I haven't been able to swallow without almost crying for a week, and now, an hour after drinking a cup of water with 1/4 tsp of cayenne, and a glass of orange juice with a little over a tsp of cayenne, I am practically pain free. A suggestion to those spicy-tolerant folks out there, up your ante. I love cayenne on food and knew 1/8 of a tsp wouldnt be enough. The tsp is perfect.
6419	111	7309	Kimberly from San Diego, Ca	2010-01-26 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I used cayenne pepper to cure my sore throat. I am 30 yrs old & have had various sore throats throughout my life. Recently, I ended my job of 10 years & therefor lost my medical insurance meaning I couldn't just go get some antibiotics or something. I had an annoying but not completely horrible sore throat for several days which seemed to hurt the most during the night & when I woke up in the morning, but the pain would subside throughout the day. This afternoon however, after about 4 days of it lingering, it turned for the worse & I would wince from merely swallowing my own saliva. I searched the internet for various cures & this site was better than any I found. After seeing all the yeahs for cayenne pepper, I gargled 1/4 teaspoon with 4 ounces of hot water. At first it didn't seem to help because the soreness was so far back that the gargling didn't really reach it. I then gargled while trying to open my throat to the point of gagging & boy did that make a difference! It reached my sinuses & very back of my throat & was soooo painful, but in a good way if that makes sense. It was like the pain was being burnt away. My throat still hurts, but it's definitely A LOT better. I'm going to go do it some more.

The chills have subsided and the congestion continues, but I believe I have purchased relief from the sore throat through cayenne. In the middle of the night, I tried the ACV, but it only relieved the symptoms temporarily. This morning, I tried 1/8 t. of cayenne to 1 T. honey in a mug of hot water. I've been sipping off and on this morning with MUCH relief from the throat issues. Thank you!

My throat had been sore for a month and I tried everything from listerine to peroxide, lemon & honey, halls, you name it I tried it.

Thanks a bunch, you just saved me a trip to the doctor which I really couldn't afford since I don't have health insurance.
6423	111	7313	Aimcdaniel from Phoenix, Az	2009-12-12 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I am a Naturopathic Medical Doctor who has not practiced for the last four years since giving birth to 2 sons. Before this, I was practicing anti-anging medicine and not doing a lot with home remedies. Needless to say, I was very rusty in the home remedy department. Two weeks ago, everyone in the family developed a cold; my 2 yr old, 9 mo old, husband and then myself. Mine started with an excruciatingly painful sore throat. I sat on the couch thinking there was no way I was going to sleep that night because it felt like someone was sand-papering the inside of my throat while holding a hot blow dryer on it. My husband made a late night run to the store to get a humidifier for my oldest son and I got on the computer to find this site of home remedies. I had my husband pick up some cayenne pepper while he was at the store. When he got home, I immediately made up the remedy. I used 1/8th tsp of Cayenne in 8 oz (a regular sized coffee cup) of warm water. I took the advice of one of the previous posters and smeared vaseline all over my lips so they would not burn from the pepper. Then I began gargling. I gargled each time for 10 seconds until the entire cup was empty. My sore throat instantly vanished. However, I didn't know if it was because the remedy actually worked, or because the cayenne kind of numbed the area. So, I repeated the gargle again. Just like magic my sore throat completely disappeared for good. This is one of the best remedies ever!!! I can't believe I forgot about this one. I definitely give it 2 thumbs up!!!!
6424	111	7314	Debnick3045 from Stuart, Florida	2009-12-03 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I had such a horrible sore throat for two days. last night the soreness was soo bad that I got out of bed and typed "sore throat" into a google search, hoping to find some releif. This site was the first one on the list. After reading everyones testimonials on the Cayenne Pepper remedy, I decided to try it. I HATE spicy food and cannot stand the burn in my mouth at all so I was skeptical but I was desperate for some relief. To my complete amazement, it worked. I gargled warm water and 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper in a small glass of warm water until it was gone. I went to sleep for about 2 hours. (It took a little while for the burn to subside but it wasn't nearly as bad as the pain of the sore throat.) When I woke up, my sore throat was more than 50% better. I just gargled it again to reinforce. What an amazing surprise! I will be telling everybody about this remedy...Thank you! :-)

Gargled twice with salt water until store opened; bought some cayenne pepper and gargled (1/4 tsp in 8 oz warm water) every two hours for 8 hours. Immediate relief after the first time. No problems with lip or tongue tingling from the pepper .... less severe than eating spicy wings.

6431	111	7321	Latoya from Greenville, North Carolina	2009-07-26 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	On Friday night, I came home sneezing and with the beginnings of a sore throat. Through the night, my sinuses drained into my throat as I slept and I woke up with a burning raw throat. I got on the internet looking for anything that would allow me to get back to sleep when I found this site. I was skeptical about the cayenne pepper and I could only imagine how it would burn. To my suprise it wasnt that bad. I started with a gargle (1/4 teaspoon in 8 oz of warm water. I gargled for about 5 minutes and had almost instant relief (this was about 7:45 am). I followed the suggestions of another user about putting vaseline on your lips prior to gargling and I think that helped with the burning sensation a lot. I also ate yogurt afterwards to increase the cooling. Later that day I ate chili from Wendy's (12:00 noon) with about 5 nice dashes of cayenne (it was great) and I had chicken noodle soup (5 pm) with about 6-7 dashes of cayenne and the spiciness was almost similar to how it tastes when I add black pepper. It was very spicy towards the end of the soup (cayenne settles at the bottom) but I bravely drank the remaining broth. I will always be greatful to this site and cayenne pepper lol
6432	111	7322	Kilihunebabe from Steilacoom, WA	2009-07-22 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	i did the cayenne pepper gargle once every 15 minutes for two hours, then drank the cayenne pepper, honey and lemon tea for about four hours following, doing the cayenne pepper gargle once an hour. the gargle definitely stung but the almost instantaneous relief was worth the moderate discomfort of the sting. over the course of 6 hours, my throat went from "streppy" to nearly pain free. i'd lay odds that if i had kept up the cayenne remedies for the remainder of the day, the entire cold would have been knocked out of the park!
6433	111	7323	Sarah from Fort Collins, CO	2009-07-15 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Cayenne pepper worked for my sore throat! I have a cold with really bad nasal congestion and a terrible sore throat. I made a "tea" with hot water, 2 T ACV and 1/4 t cayenne. I'm not sure if I would have been able to drink it if I wasn't completely congested because my husband said it smelled terrible, but to me it just tasted like hot water. I drank two cups of this tea and my sore throat is much better. I was hoping the cayenne would help with the congestion too, but hasn't so far.
6434	111	7324	Miguel from Carson City, Nevada	2009-07-12 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I was really skeptical to use cayenne pepper. Since May I have had a horrible cough and I've been coughing up mucus for about two months. I've also had strep throat 3 times this year. Right now it's the third time. I didn't even think I had cayenne pepper and I eventually decided to look for it and to my surprise I did have it. I was originally going to try gargling cayenne pepper and peroxide. I decided to try this instead. It honestly worked for me and I am very surprised. Even drinking cold water was incredibly painful. It was swallowing that hurt the most, though. My throat is still a little sore but it doesn't sting nearly as much as it did before. I'm still drinking my tea and I also made ramen with some cayenne pepper so I'm sure by the time I finish them both I'll feel a lot better.

In a desperate move I tried the 1/2 t of cayenne pepper mixed with a mug full of warm water, gargling for 10 seconds every 15 minutes... it was so disgusting and my mouth was on fire after each attempt... but 2 hours later and I can swallow without the stabbing pain at the back of my throat.

6437	111	7327	Eveline from Candian living in Spain	2009-06-05 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I was having problems a couple of weeks ago with a very mild sore throat. One of those that hurt in the morning but would go away during the course of the day but for me that usually is a warning that something is coming. I started gargling with salt water (my previous favourite rememdy). I also read about the honey and ACV so I mixed that up and would have tsps of that every so often throughout the day. However, morning after morning my throat would still be sore. I was anxious to get rid of it because I was packing up and starting to travel around Spain. Then I added cayenne pepper (maybe 1/4 tsp.). Wow. What a great thing. The very next morning I had no more sore throat. Now, as I travel I have half a lemon in water with cayenne every morning and sometimes at night as well. With traveling on trains and planes and changing climates lately from very hot to quite cool and wet I want to make sure I keep any illnesses at bay. Yay, cayenne pepper!
6438	111	7328	Norman from Spokane, Washington	2009-05-31 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	i recently read this Cayanne pepper article after having a TERRIBLE sore throat for several days which made it hard to breath at times and made me short on breath constantly. i had been taking meds which are suppose to help... but didnt. i found this and tried it, and after only about two hours or so i could breath well and my throat didnt hurt at all. It did get worse to start, but after about the third gargle, i coughed something up and was alot better. PS This will most likly make you sweat, but way worth it.

So, since I was a little frightened to use it, i did about 1/2 cup of water, a coupple sprikles of cayenne pepper and put a genrous amount of honey. I feel a lot better! But after reading the Nays, i would not suggest sipping it, unless in OJ.

Then I spit it out and I could not believe, it but my throat was fine. I put the rest in the fridge just in case it came back the next day, but it didn't. It has been 5 days and I am still fine. Thanks for this site.
6441	111	7331	Celena  from Morgantown, WV	2009-05-20 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I used a little less then 1/8 teaspoon in my mixture, I also added 1/2 juice of a lemon, and 1 teaspoon honey, which made the "tea" taste better. I've used this remedy before, but only after I had went to the Doctor, I needed relief before the antibiotics kicked in. I have recommended this to friends and family because it truly works. I had a horrible sore throat last night before bed, I went to sleep thinking I'll call the doctor in the morning, but when I woke up at 5am with my throat hurting so bad I couldn't sleep, I remembered this remedy, so at 5 in the morning here I am gargling with the mixture. This gave me enough relief that I was able to go back to sleep, and when I woke up 2 hours later I went right back to the gargle. My throat feels so much better!! I'm not completely cured, but I'm sure that I will be by the days end.
6442	111	7332	Elena from Honolulu, Hawaii	2009-05-15 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I recently had a sore throat that was plaguing me for over 3 weeks. Not only was the pain affecting what I ate, but it was affecting my sleeping, and I was just too tired for everything. Nothing over-the-counter worked. My doctor couldn't prescribe anything except to say to continue with the warm salt gargle and to continue with over-the-counter meds. The salt garble wasn't really working until I added a couple of dashes of cayanne pepper. In about 8 ounces of warm salted water, I started with one dash and finally built up to 4 dashes. It's important to continue to stir the water so that the pepper doesn't settle. I garbled every morning, when I came home from work, and before bed for 3 days. Because I couldn't gargle the water deep enough down my throat without gagging, I resorted to drinking ramen broth with as much cayanne pepper as I could handle. I sipped a little of the broth with pepper at each meal. I found that the hotter the liquid, the more pepper I could tolerate. And the more pepper I consumed, the better my throat felt. I also found that a couple of dashes in hot cocoa is great. I used a popular hot cocoa brand that had milk in the powered mix that only required water. To that I added two dashes of cayanne pepper. I was able to tolerate up to about 7 dashes of pepper. In about 3 days I was pretty much cured. I continued to drink my cocoa mix with cayanne pepper once a day for about a week just in case, and well, because I aquired a taste for it.

I decided to warm a coffee mug with warm water and about 1/2 a teaspoon full of cayenne pepper and gargled. It feels remarkably better! The only side effect I would say I felt is that my lips are kind of burning like I just ate some spicy salsa. But definitely worth it!
6444	111	7334	Tricia from Sanford, Florida	2009-05-01 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Yesterday morning I woke up with a sore throat, and it wasn't the dry, itchy kind, either. It was mildly painful, and I knew if I didn't do something fast, it would only get worse. I gargled a small amount of hydrogen peroxide, and it relieved the symptoms, and I felt fine until mid-afternoon. The pain in my throat started creeping back in, I started to develope a runny nose, had a very mild fever, and my body started to to ache a little. When I arrived home, I could barely swallow, it hurt so much! Then, bypassing the hydrogen peroxide, I approx. 1/8 of a teaspoon of cayenne pepper and approx. a tablespoon of honey to a cup of hot water. I took my time, sipping the concoction over a period of about hour while I browsed the web. Well, I went from a pain level that was between 8-9 on a scale of 10 to a pain level between 4-5. I mixed another cup of the mixture and sipped at that for another half hour. By the time I went to bed, the pain level was between 1-2. I slept through the night and when I woke the pain was almost completely gone. I'm sipping on some more right now, and to be honest, my throat feels back to normal. My nose is still a bit runny, and I'm extremely tired and a little weak, but that's about it. I'm going to add apple cider vinegar to my routine today. I've been rather lax about taking the ACV lately, but that won't happen again, believe me! Bottom line---I'm convinced that the cayenne pepper cured my sore throat!

6446	111	7336	Cathy from Atlanta, GA	2009-04-16 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I want to thank everyone who provided information about the cayenne pepper treatment for a severe sore throat. I've got an acute bacterial infection, which has spread to my eye and my throat. As I'm on antibiotics, I did not want to use any pharmaceutical cold rememdies, but my throat has literally felt as if hot coals were stacked inside it. I could not sleep, could not eat, and was having more & more trouble swallowing. I found the earth clinic site; carefully read all the "sore throat" posts, and decided to try the cayenne pepper mixed with pulpy orange juice. I put 1/8 teaspoon into a 10 ounce glass; mixed it up well, and drank the whole glass. I'm not sure what the healing properties of cayenne pepper are, but I can tell you I already feel some relief. The pulpy orange juice apparently dilutes the cayenne pepper, and I had no pain or burning while drinking it. I plan to drink some more later on today, and am keeping my fingers crossed. Thanks so much.
6447	111	7337	Alex from Chico, CA	2009-04-14 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Like Magic! I did two (light) shakes of cayenne in a cup and a half of water with either a tablespoon to two tablespoons of lemon juice or tangerine juice and a tablespoon of honey mixed in warm water. (important to mix because the cayenne will float to the top and give you extra spicy gargle if you don't mix) Gargled every 15 minutes for about a four hour period. A couple times I alternated with 1/2 Hydrogen Peroxide 1/2 water gargle or just straight water when the heat from the cayenne was too much. Put four shakes of cayenne in the chili I had for dinner. Got up in the middle of the night and gargled once with the hydrogen peroxide and water mix and took a ibuprofen because I was still having pain. When I woke up three hours later -- the lump in my throat had disappeared and I was spitting up junk. Have been feeling great ever since! I am a cayenne fan thanks to your posting!! Thanks for saving me! I got to enjoy the last day of my vacation(finally!).
6448	111	7338	Justin from Pittsburgh, PA/USA	2009-04-11 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Crazy Pepper gargle works...at least, for now! I'm not a measuring type of guy so I'm not sure how much of each but here's how it looked to me: just took a ceramic coffee cup, about a 1/2 ounce lemon juice, 1/2 ounce water, teaspoon honey, and covered the top with crushed red pepper. I microwaved it for 30 seconds, stirred, gargled and swallowed. I was able to get down about 3 gulps before I started sweating! My stomach feels like I just ate a bunch of hot wings, but my throat feels better.
6449	111	7339	Krista from Merced, CA	2009-04-07 00:00:00	BETTER BUT NOT CURED	2	0	I have to admit, I was skeptical like a lot of peoples testimonies that I read were. I have acid reflux and I get colds quite often due to a low immune system. When I get bad colds, I get really bad sore throats. Today I have had a sore throat for two days straight, and when I googled natural remedies for a sore throat, this site came up. I read some testimonies that seemed scary but most were positive so I tried it. Keep in mind, spicy foods do NOT agree with me and I have a weak tolerance for it. But I used the 2 tbsp of honey, about a 3 second squeeze of the "real lemon" juice, and 5-6 shakes of cayenne pepper and heated it for 20 seconds and gargled it three times. I tested the taste with my finger first to make sure I could handle it and it was fine, so I gargled it. The cayenne was not too hot for me, but the honey was a bit sweet for my taste. My sore throat isn't gone, but it does feel a little better. I probably didn't do it long enough due to my gag reflex I don't tolerate gargling well, so tomorrow I'm going to try 1/8 teaspoon in my broth soup and see how it does if it still hurts tomorrow. Thanks for whoever first posted this, I will definitely recommend this to whoever has a sore throat.
6450	111	7340	Travis from South Jordan, Utah	2009-03-30 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I am manly, right? So I decided to use two tablespoons of cayenne pepper with 1/4 cup of warm water. The first gargle was ok, the second was horrible. I actually coughed it up through my nose. That was a miracle cure, because my sinuses immediately cleared out from having them blasted with pepper. My throat feels a lot better too.
6451	111	7341	Brittney from Vanceboro, North Carolina	2009-03-17 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	So I googled how to cure sore throats and I came upon this website. I read a few negative comments about the Cayenne Pepper, so at first I was somewhat scared to try it. But trying almost everything, I decided to give it a try. I used the 2tbsp of honey, 2tbsp of lemon juice, and exactly 1/4 tsp of Crushed Red Pepper, I believe Cayenne Pepper and Red Pepper are the exact same thing. I microwaved it for 15 seconds, stirred it up, and I gargled for about 15-20 seconds twice. I swallowed a generous amount, it was very spicy but I was able to handle it. It had a spicy aftertaste in my mouth and throat so I drank Kool-Aid and it took the spicyness away. And I was very happy with the results, it took a lot of the pain away, it still hurts but it's very, very mild but not as discomforting as it was before. If it helps any, instead of using lemon juice from the bottle, I used a lemon, cut it in half and squeezed out all the juice, since the lemon is much fresher than lemon juice in the bottle. But I will definetly keep using this whenever I get a sore throat and I'll spread the word of it's wonders.
6452	111	7342	Rob from South Jordan, Utah	2009-03-13 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I had a severe sore throat that Started Monday night. I took the maximum amount of advil over two days thinking it would go away, however, it kept getting worse. I was concerned that it had turned into strep. I started to gargle 1/8 of a teaspoon of Cayenne Pepper every 15 minutes for the first couple of hours about 5PM. I then gargled about every half hour until I went to bed. Last night was the first night in several nights that I didn't wake up because of pain. When I woke up this morning, I still had a slight amount of pain but it has continued to improve through today. By noon the pain was so minimal, I didn't notice it unless I stopped to think about it. Thanks for listing this online!

No relief at all... After researching the pain reducing properties of cayenne...it was rather perversely comical as I winced in burning pain during and after gargling. After all, my throat was raw and I was putting pepper on it!

After a little over a week all but the lingering sore throat have passed. Nothing was working, so tonight I found this site, read the cayenne pepper remedies and thought it couldn't make it worse. I followed the recommendation to mix it with orange juice. I mixed 1/8 tsp with 8 oz of orange juice and drank it slowly. Within 15 minutes my throat felt better than it has in days. Thank you! I will actually get some sleep now. :-)

Incredible pain on the left side of my throat.Swollen glands.Tongue having trouble pushing even liquids down. What do you do when you can't sleep? Well, surf the net, of course! Found this lovely site. Am trying the Cayenne pepper with honey and warm water suggestion. Am only 3/4 down but there already is some improvement. i may sleep tonight! By the way, how is it that everybody has apple cider vinegar on hand? I only have malt and balsamic in my cupboard!I suppose that won't do? Since I'm up I could go to the 24 hour quikkie mart!

I have had a killer sore throat, and my voice is really husky, close to laryngitis now! This weekend, starting tomorrow, I have a 2 hour radio talk show, then right after that, I head straight to my wedding job. I actually have 3 weddings this weekend, Friday, Saturday and Sunday! Great job and great schedule yes! But with my voice the way it is, I am so afraid I have to cancel all gigs! That would cost me over 2000 dollars of income! I saw this site and started with the cayenne and vinegar gargle, and have been drinking it constantly for about 2 hours. So far, my voice is getting better! Hopefully it will restore completely!!! I cant cancel the jobs so this is my only hope!

If the symptoms do not go away easily, I then use it with the "Hydrogen Peroxide in the ear" remedy. I have passed on this information to others and it has helped them too. Of course most people do not do it several times, which is essential to get the best results. Several time better than any cough syrup.

I've been taking Dayquil and Nyquil, but it hasn't helped much at all. Anyway, I found this website and tried the cayenne pepper treatment. I used 1/2 cup of lukewarm water with 1/8 teaspoon of cayenne pepper and have been gargling for about half an hour. It's already working! I was to the point of not even being able to drink water or take medicine, and now I can eat solid food! The soreness isn't completely gone, but it's so much better than it was. Cayenne pepper is awesome!

I put in 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne and gargled for 20 seconds then drank the rest of the tea. My throat was realy swolen and the swelling whent right down after the gargle. I even enjoy the taste! vinegar used to work pritty well but this time it didn't do much (and vinegar taste is just about unbareable) this cayenne worked when vinegar wouldn't.

I usually manage to swollow small amounts which i think may help but all in all it works better than ANYTHING you can buy. As i browse the site more i tend to find that this is the case. I have tried this a few times already and it works every time.

I was so concerned, because the play opens in about 2 weeks, and I have a pretty nasty cold; it's been going on for a few days now. I'm pretty stuffed up, but my hugest concern is the sore throat I've got. I'm having dryish and mucusish coughs as well as a croak when I talk and sing. I'm not concerned now however, because I just tried the cayenne pepper / orange juice remedy, and I can feel it working. So far, I've taken 1/4 a teaspoon of cayenne pepper over 2 glasses of orange juice, in one hour, and I do feel better. It should be noted that I'm not cured, probably because I waited so long to start doing something about it, but I do honestly believe that within a few more days of regularly drinking cayenne and OJ, that I'll be just fine right in time for the musical. While I was drinking it, there was a slight spiciness, maybe even a bit of a burning sensation, but definitely nothing no one can't handle. I have a very low tolerance for pain and spicy foods. If you have a sore throat, PLEASE do try cayenne pepper, I feel so much better after just doing it once and briefly, it's amazing!

6470	111	7360	Jennifer from Virginia Beach, VA	2009-01-08 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I get regular sore throats in cold and allergy season. I never had my tonsils removed and I can feel sore throats coming on. I went online tonight and tried looking up natural sore throat remedies. I had heard of the apple cider vinegar method before, which seems pretty popular too, but I hadn't heard of the cayenne pepper method. Within just the first gargle (about 1/4t pepper to about 1/2 cup hot water) I felt relief. It wasn't gone completely because I had just started doing it but I could at least swallow without having to brace myself. The comment below about the terrible pain and such scared me at first but it's really not bad, especially when you feel the relief. It's like eating spicy salsa, your lips are a little 'warm' afterwards, but it's not worse than a spicy meal! If you're in pain, it's worth a try!!
6471	111	7361	Kathleen from Stone Mountain, GA	2008-12-27 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Oh my goodness! I am so happy to report that the cayenne pepper remedy worked! I had a sore throat for like 2 weeks. I tried all kinds of OC remedies. I was in the hospital for an unrelated ailment and they gave me some throat spray. (Yeah right! My throat laughed at that stuff) So I aint gonna lie, I was skeptical about the cayenne pepper and water thing. But I did it for about 6 hours (12 ounces of water and 1/8 teaspoon cayenne) I had to swallow a few drops each time cuz I couldn't reach the soreness with just gargling. It burned like crazy! But it was worth it! The next day I woke up and my throat felt like 90% better! So I did it some more that day and the next thing I know I was feeling NO pain in my throat! Thanks so much for this information!
6472	111	7362	Jen from Orlando, FL	2008-12-21 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	You have GOT to be kidding me. I've had one of the worst sore throats of my life for the past few days. I had been trying to take over the counter cold medicine, but nothing worked at all. Then tonight when I tried to go to sleep, my throat was throbbing so bad that I could feel the pain in both ears - I didn't think I could stand it anymore, so I got out of bed to Google some late night urgent care clinics in my area. Since it was a Sunday night, everything had closed early...the only option left was the Emergency Room, which seemed a little drastic, even though I did consider it since my pain was so bad. I stumbled across this site when I searched for 'sore throat remedy' - I've never tried any home remedies for anything before. I started reading through the testimonials on this cayenne pepper trick and I decided to give it a try. I figured it wouldn't make me feel any worse, so why not. And my husband was in bed already, so he wouldn't be there to make fun of me throwing random spices around in the kitchen at midnight. I'm not a huge fan of most teas, and I couldn't stand the thought of just mixing cayenne pepper with water, so I decided to use canned soup, and then add the cayenne pepper as a seasoning. I'm not even done with the soup right now and I feel GREAT! Better than I have in the past few days. Granted, I still have a cold, so I still have the runny nose (even though the spicy flavor helped clean that out a bit too!), a tiny bit of a sore throat and a little bit of a cough...but WOW...this is amazing. I used: 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper 1 can of canned soup (I actually had a 'mexican style' soup flavor at the house, which worked well with the seasoning... but it will probably work with anything!) I also kept a small glass of pulp-free orange juice nearby, since other posters said they needed to use it to cool off the heat at times - I definitely did! This is amazing - if you have a sore throat...DO THIS! I wish I would have known about this years ago! I realize it may not work for everyone, but I'm glad I'm one of the people it works for.

However, I went overboard in my desperate attempts to cure my painful throat, pouring several tablespoonfuls of cayenne pepper in hot water instead of the recommended teaspoonful (that amount did not work for me), and ended up with a nasty cough when the pepper caught in my throat.
6474	111	7364	Alice from Raleigh, North Carolina USA	2008-12-19 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Thank you so very much for this site. I am plagued by sinus issues and each time the seasons change, I get sick. It always starts off with a sore throat due to the post nasal drip in the back of my throat. But this time after years and years of dealing with this and taking medications upon medications, I decided to try a remedy for sore throat. Saw this website and tried the pepper. It works!! Yes, there is some discomfort from the pepper. Put vaseline on your lips before you start. Just stick with it and take it consistently for about 24 to 48 hours. Repeating every 4 hours or so. Also it is better if you start taking the mixture at the FIRST sign of a sore throat. I also rinse with Neil Med Nasal Sinus Rinse after gargling with cayenne pepper solution. It works people, it simply works!! What have you got to lose...a sore throat?

The show is tomorrow and my throat has gotten so bad that it is hard to talk let alone sing. I tried the first thing I saw and I instanly felt better.

A mess in other words. I couldn't sleep, so ended up hunting for remedies and found this site at 2:30AM in the morning. A quick trip to the kitchen, find the Cayenne powder and after 10 minutes of gargling, 5 minutes apart, blessed relief. I was asleep 45 minutes later. Thanks very much.

After researching this site I finally developed a remedy: 1 cup hot water, 3 tablespoons Apple Cider Vinegar, 3 tablespoons Honey and enough Cayenne Pepper to cover the entire top layer of water (5-6 sprinkles). Then I gargled then swallowed about 4 full mouth full every 30 minutes to an hour over a 6 hour period. I went from severe pain (9 of 10) to slight pain (2 of 10) within 4 hours. I also sprinkled the Cayenne Pepper on dinner, The next morning the sore throat was completely gone. Side note: On day 3 of my sore throat I tried gargling and swallowing ACV and hot water for a 7 hour period, this only gave me temporary relief but the sore throat was back in full swing the next day.

6482	111	7372	Kaylee from Hyde Park, Utah	2008-11-20 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I tried the Cayenne remedy for my sore throat. I read about one person who tried mixing the Cayenne with bullion and it got me thinking. I don't really enjoy downing hot drinks, but being in college, I have a lot of Ramen Noodles around. I made some of the noodles and then put 1/4 tsp of the pepper (I accidentally put a little too much in, so be careful!) in the normal amount of broth. I felt immediate results while just eating lunch. Drinking the broth afterwards is suggested, but I found it a bit difficult to do. I also tried just a little bit of the pepper straight on my tongue. Not a lot, but just enough to taste. It wasn't uncomfortably hot, but it gave just enough heat that when I breathed it would go to my throat and soothe it.

My daughter brought home "that 1st ugly cold" of the year and I've been off work for 2 days with this horrid sore throat and a cough that won't stop. I am trying the cayenne pepper with a small can of V8 vegetable juice. Wow! I'm glad I had a V8...with cayenne pepper. My ears have quit hurting...they're burning a little, but I think it is from the infection that was trying to harbor in there. My sinuses have opened and my throat is not sore anymore, just a pleasant kick. I used a small can + 3/4 tsp (pretty strong) of cayenne. For those that don't tolerate hot/spicy foods, start out with 1/4 tsp. Good Luck!
6486	111	7376	Stel from Sydney, Australia	2008-11-02 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have had a sore throat for 2 weeks now. I was prescribed antibiotics but they had no effect after finishing the course, so I was then re-diagnosed with a viral infection. I've been trying to ride it out since. I've been taking lozenges with anaesthetic agents in them to ease the soreness, as well as an iodine gargle, which is supposed to kill viruses and bacteria. Both have only had temporary effects. So as a last resort, I bought some Cayenne pepper, after reading the many comments on this website. My concoction is based on the good old honey lemon water recipe. - 1/8 tsp Cayenne pepper - 1/2 lemon, squeezed - 2 tsps honey - 1 tsp raw sugar - Water, boiled I'm drinking my first cup right now, and I can definitely say that there has been an immediate improvement. I am actually not a fan of chilli and spices, but this drink goes down quite nicely. It doesn't taste that much different from the standard honey lemon drink, except it has a nice kick to it. I am noting that the further down the cup I go, the spicier it gets, as the Cayenne pepper tends to settle down to the bottom. Cayenne pepper seems to only produce a kick in my throat; I don't feel it in my mouth at all. And it feels nice! The razor-in-throat feeling has now been replaced by a spicy tingle. As it is only my first day of drinking Cayenne pepper, time will tell whether the sore throat will go away once and for all. I will definitely continue drinking this in the next hours/days, as the short-term effects at least are noticeably positive.

Yesterday I woke up with a wicked sore throat, every time I swallowed it was like swallowing razor blades, and the infection had spread to my ears, because my ears were burning as well. Today I read about using the cayenne pepper and decided to give it a try. At 12:00 noon, I drank 1 cup of chicken broth with 1/4 teaspoon cayenne. I didn't notice a change in my throat right away, but the burning and pressure in my eardrums went away immediately. At 1:30 I drank a cup of tea with: 1/4 teaspoon cayenne 1 teaspoon lemon juice 1 teaspoon honey. THIS REALLY WORKS! Immediately after finishing the tea, I felt 50% better. I will drink some more in about 2 hours. Good luck and feel better!
6488	111	7378	Terri from Brisbane, Australia	2008-10-28 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Thanks to Karen from Pennsylvania (10/15/2008) I think I've discovered the ultimate Aussie version of this amazing cure! This poster mentioned mixing the cayenne with bullion. I adapted the suggestion by mixing a scant 1/4 teaspoon of ground cayenne pepper (extra hot) with one teaspoon of Vegemite in near boiling water. Yes, my lips and mouth burned, but it was far more palatable than straight water & cayenne. I'm still sipping it as I write this and 90 minutes after taking my first dose, the swollen throat that kept me awake last night and in pain all day is 70% better. Like others, I intend to persist. The side benefit of this mix is that Vegemite (a yeast extract similar to Marmite/Promite) is a rich source of vitamin B. A teaspoon of Vegemite mixed with hot water is a popular old cold & flu remedy. Thanks to all for their feedback and variations. PS: Remember to stir before every sip. If you have trouble tolerating the burning sensation on your lips and don't have Vaseline at hand, try sipping it through a straw.
6489	111	7379	Teresa from Hopewell, NJ	2008-10-28 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Hi! I recently tried the Cayenne pepper remedy for a sore throat and found it really did relieve the pain. First I tried it mixed with just water, about 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon in a small galss of water. I gargled and also sipped the solution and found it did numb the pain. The next morning I felt much better and took another "dose" this time mixed with vegetable juice, and now the soreness is just about gone! Thanks!
6490	111	7380	Ella from Beaverton, Oregon United States	2008-10-26 00:00:00	NAY	1	0	I tried the cayenne pepper remedy, and gargled and drank it straight with water, like some other people did...It did not work at all. I gargled 5 times and drank it, it hurt so bad, but I thought it would work. It didn't. Pain and agony was all it caused me. My advice: Do not try this with just water. These were the measurements that I used: 1/2 cup water 1/4 tsp cayenne Thanks so much.
6491	111	7381	TM from Medford, NY	2008-10-22 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I woke up this morning with a killer sore throat. Tried a salt water gargle, chloraseptic (which worked temporarily). So when I googled sore throat remedies I found your site. seeing all the positive results for cayenne pepper I gave it a try. I mixed up a tea spoonful in a V8 and sipped at it. I have to say it really worked. I am now able to talk with no throat pain. thank you very much and keep up the good work.

6494	111	7384	Karen from Birdsboro, Pennsylvania	2008-10-15 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I read about using cayanne pepper on this website and decided to try it as I always get sore throats when the weather changes. My doctor always tells me to gargle with salt water but it only gives temporary relief at best. Since I like bullion I decided to make really strong bullion (2 cubes to 1 cup of water) to take the place of the salt water and then added cayanne pepper 1/8th tsp. That way I could keep sipping it and swallowing it rather than spitting it out. I couldn't believe how quickly this worked and have been using this ever since.
6495	111	7385	Don from Southwest, Michigan, USA	2008-10-10 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	The dry sharp painful sore throat that is going around this fall (2008) seems to respond to cayenne pepper and garlic tea. At least it worked for me. . The garlic powder is optional but you must use the cayenne. Put 1/8 tsp. cayenne pepper powder and 1/8 tsp. garlic powder into a mug of hot hot water. Sip it slowly to let the brew linger at the back of the throat before swallowing. Keep the cayenne circulated in the water while drinking. Take it about every hour or so until the pain is gone. It only took three cups for my sore throat to dissappear. Note: I notice that some people use orange juice to cool the pepper. To me, the warmth of the water and the pepper is soothing and part of the healing process.
6497	111	7387	Dana from Toronto, ON	2008-10-02 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Yesterday I could barely speak, my throat was so raw. I tried gargling with warm salt water, but that didn't work for long. I then put a generous squirt of lemon juice into 1/2 cup of water and drank that, and it worked for much longer than the salt water, but my sore throat did return. So I went online and found this cayenne pepper tea remedy. At that point, I was ready to try anything. So last night, I drank 3 cups of this tea, and had one big cup this morning. My sore throat is pretty much gone, although there's a wee bit still lingering. To erradicate it completely, I will drink another glass or two tonight. Unfortunately for my family and co-workers, I can now yabber on in my usual manner, once again.
6498	111	7388	Kelly from Scanton, pa	2008-10-02 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I had a really bad sore throat that started yesterday and I could hardly swallow without bracing myself for the pain. I had my husband buy some cayenne pepper for me and drank a 1/4 tsp in 6 oz of orange juice and gargled 1/4 tsp in warm water twice more, waiting about 15 minutes in between. I went to sleep after taking some medicine and got a decent night sleep. I have slight pain in the back of my throat today, I have not taken any more meds, I have gargled the pepper twice more. I have no other symptoms except I am really tired and have a slight pain in my throat. I think it would have been a lot worse without the cayenne pepper.
6499	111	7389	Beau from Calgary, AB	2008-10-02 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I was just reading about Cayenne pepper being the super awesome end-all cure to the sore throat. I'd have to agree. Years ago, I had a very swollen, dry sore throat. I hadn't eaten anything for six days, except warm tea. I was feeling excrutiatingly hungry, but the thought of swallowing anything made me gag. For some reason, I went crazy and poured myself a small glass of Mott's Clamato EXTRA SPICY which is spiced using tabasco peppers. Seconds after drinking the first sip, my sore throat was numbed, and replaced with a warm tingling sensation from the spice. I continued to drink small amounts throughout the day, and went to bed with little pain and had an amazing sleep. I awoke the next morning with a very dull pain and no where near the swelling. I was able to eat, and speaking wasn't excrutiating. Since then, every time I've had a swollen sore throat, I'll sip a tall glass of the Mott's and the next morning it will be gone.
6500	111	7390	Ross from Scottsdale, AZ	2008-09-27 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	After having a bad sore throat for the past 3 days and trying the common things like, hot tea, gargling with salt water, lots of rest, over the counter items nothing was working. I searched this site and found out about Cayenne. I made the following: 1 cup of hot water 1 tea bag 1/4 teaspoon of Cayenne 2 teaspoons of honey mixed it up and sipped the hot tea with cayenne. Hard to believe but most of the pain in my throat went away after just drinking half of the cup. I will finish and repeat with another 3 cups as recommended. Thx to everyone out there.
6501	111	7391	Nathaniel from Mankato, MN, USA	2008-09-25 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Wow! I started getting a nasty sore throat last night and haven't slept more than 20 minutes in the last 24 hours or so because of it, not to mention that I haven't been able to talk for the last 12 hours or so. I had tried ibruprophen, aspirin, Tylenol, cough drops, tea with honey, gargling salt water, and some throat spray and this is the only thing that's worked! It is a little uncomfortable, but like someone else said the pain from the cayenne pepper is so much more tolerable than the pain of the sore throat. I'll have to remember this one! Thanks!
6502	111	7392	Lauren from Vista, CA	2008-09-25 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	The cayenne pepper is amazing! I have had a cold for a couple of days and I thought it was going away and then today I woke up with a major sore throat. I could not talk AT ALL. . . tried some licorice tea with honey, didn't help! So I then made some tomato soup and put the cayenne pepper in it (a couple shakes) i could feel it helping the whole time I was eating it. a little later I just put 1/4 teaspoon in a warm glass of water and gargled it throughout the next 10 minutes. That was at least 5 hours ago and my throat still doesn't hurt. I can't feel any throat pain! Talking, swallowing, coughing, breathing doesn't hurt! yay!

6504	111	7394	Allianna from Azusa, California	2008-09-18 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	On Tuesday I took one shot of hot water with a little less than 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper. Yes, it burned. But it eased the sharp pain I was having in my throat. Three hours later my throat was still hurting a bit, so I thought, what the heck, I'll try another shot. It burned a little more... and that was the end of my sore throat! It is now Thursday, and I am still sick and sniffling and coughing... but at least I don't have a sore throat! Thank you cayenne pepper! Side note: I cannot handle hot and spicy foods, but this was not bad. On the other hand, my husband, who has this same cold or whatever it is, has a sensitive stomach, and this remedy made him nauseated. Just a word of caution to those with sensitive stomachs.

I tried all of my usual things I do for it, but it seemed to get worse so I searched home remedies on yahoo and found this site. Desperate for relief, I went straight out and got some ground cayenne pepper, mixed 1/4 tsp. with 4 oz. of warm water, started gargling and at first, it set my mouth on fire. I thought, I should have read through more pages, but I was so desperate for relief, I kept on with it and finally just drunk the last two sips and amazingly it instantly helped, it has been about 30 minutes. This has truly amazed me! Thanks to all who took the time to send feedback.

He has been sick for over a week and having a time shaking it. I was determined not to get into the same boat. I jumped onto the computer found this web site and the overwhelming votes for cayenne pepper. I tried the mixture all day yesterday. I fell asleep around 8pm woke up at 2am and i felt like i had swords in my throat. Took another shoot. Woke up 9 am was about to take another shot when i realized my throat was not sore AT ALL! 24 hours later I am still congested and have a couch but that dreadful sting in my throat is completely gone. A huge thanks to all who contributes to this great site. I am about to find out how to un-stuff my nose! 1 shot glass 1/2 acv 1/2 honey 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper

6510	111	7400	Tyler from Cape Coral, FL	2008-09-09 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Actually, I'm surprised to say this stuff is a life saver! I was suffering from a severe sore throat and cold for a few days. Finally I was fed up and was forced to try something different before I went to the doc. I was at work when I purchased and used the product. Just sprinkled a little dab of pepper in my water, enough to where it turned the water orangeish don't know the exact measurements. Anyways I gargled it a few times once every hour. My throat still hurt after that so I thought "Well so much for that idea". Then I went to lunch, took a short nap and when I woke up my throat was almost completely healed! I was like wow! Impressive. I kept thinking maybe it was just coincidence but I'm sure it wouldn't have went away that fast with the pain I had earlier in the day. Try this first and ignore everything else this is all you need! Also, it kind of left a weird taste in my mouth after awhile but it's better than suffering from severe throat pain which is the worst body pain you can have!

I have always liked dill pickle juice and, as chance would have it, I was suffering from leg cramps when I took 5 gulps of juice. Lo and behold, my cramps went away. I now make my own dill pickles that uses cayenne pepper in the recipe. I am currently working on a concoction that includes elderberrys, garlic, honey, cayenne, vinegar, as my base. Any input would be appreciated. Dill pickle recipe: 3 cups water 1 cup apple cider vinegar 1/2 cup pickling salt 1 clove garlic 1 or 2 cayenne peppers 1 tsp. dry dill 1/2 tsp. Italian seasoning

I believe in the no doctors approach letting my body heal itself with a healthy diet and lifestyle. The pain kept getting worse. I woke up in the middle of the night googled sore throat cure and up came this site. I drank cayenne straight in water and i could feel it working right away opening up all my passages even breathing better. It is now 30 minutes after and my pain went from a 10 of 10 to a 2 of 10. Thank you so much.
6513	111	7403	Lynnette from Corpus Christi, TX	2008-09-04 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	With much hesitance, I tried the cayenne just with water (1/4 tsp to about a 1/2 cup water- no honey, nothing else added. The hottest doesn't bother me- just the thought of adding more fire to the already severely sore throat scared me. I was amazed after I tried the first dose. Instantly I was able to swallow, so continued taking throughout the evening. I would swallow some of the last gargle which helped even more. My daugther even tried a some when she began to get a sore throat, and has only needed the one dose (she did use less cayenne). I did coat her lips with chapstick first, and have her rinse immediately.

When I attempted to use this remedy, I used a rather generous version of 1/4 tsp and WHOA did I get a nice little kick in the ribs on a small little sip.

I was amazed how effective it is. It is probably about 80% better after 3 or 4 cups over 24 hours. I felt a difference after the very first cup, but with each additional cup it is subsiding. The website is amazing! I'm sending a lot of people to look at it for various remedies.
6516	111	7406	Raymond from Chicago, IL	2008-09-02 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have had an annoying and painful sore throat for four days now. I was browsing everywhere and everything that can help me stop this pain. I went to my local osco and spent some cash, picked up tussin "cough and cold" halls drops ect ect.... whatever said relives pain due to sore throat. So Pumping myself full of this and that did little to get rid of the pain. More of less it just masked it. Then I come across your site. Bam!! cayenne pepper i thought hey why not give it a try. My first mistake was thinking i can just drink down 1/4 tsp of pepper in a shot glass filled with honey and melted in the microwave. I threw up after the fist half gulp. The texture was blaaa and that amount so fast turned my stomach upside down and right side up. My next try i gargled some and the burning was wonderful on my ever so sore throat. I still however had pain okay one more try. Finally i took a full cup of green tea put the 1/4 tps in added some honey 1 spoon and slowly sipped away. It is now 5am and im finally able to sleep. Thank you everyone for the advice.
6517	111	7407	Ellen from Arlington, Texas	2008-08-31 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have had a sore throat for months due to GERD. They both got much worse when I caught a stomach virus on top of it. My throat became so sore that I was miserable. I had already had a positive experience using apple cider vinegar for the stomach issues so I looked up sore throat cures. Since so many people had used cayenne pepper successfully, I decided to try it. I shook the cayenne pepper bottle about three times into about 4 to 6 ounces of water. I gargled and within seconds my sore throat no longer hurt. As a matter of fact, it did not hurt at all for the rest of the day. The next day it hurt a little bit again so I did another cayenne gargle. It worked. I don't love cayenne pepper but I love that it makes the pain go away. It is very much worth it to me to use it. I'm totally convinced and will use it from now on for sore throats. Thank you all so very much! Best wishes, Ellen

I mixed about 5 shakes of the pepper, put some honey in there for taste, and about 16oz of warm water. I gargled for about 45 minutes sipping and gargling, repeat. It's been about an hour and a half since I started and I've had no reaction to it. It's not doing anything for me, which is a shame because I really wanted this to work.

I've been taking echinacea & goldenseal, Aleve to help the pain, drinking orange juice, and tried Dayquil which helped temporarily. I googled home remedies for a sore throat this morning and came across this site which has such a great response for Cayenne Pepper that I thought I'd give it a shot. I've just prepared a cup of hot green tea with the following: 1/4 tsp Cayenne 2 tbsp Honey 12-16 oz water 1 green tea bag (any tea of your choice would work, I just use it for flavor :)) I've had one drink of this cup of tea as it is a little too hot and IT WORKS! My throat barely hurts, and I'm sure by the end of the cup, the pain will have subsided almost completely. I'll definitely keep it up till it's gone. Thank you, thank you, thank you! This site is the best. :)

It seems that standing up I was not getting the liquid back far enough. My soreness or pain is farther in and up towards my left ear and laying down helped the water go back farther. I had to cover up my mouth with a cloth so as not splatter cayenne water on my face or eyes. I wonder if some of the Nays are not getting the liquid back far enough? and THANKS to all...

6522	111	7412	Lisa from Loveland, Colorado	2008-07-31 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I've had a sore throat for five days and I've tried everything: saltwater, tea, lemon juice, milk, cold medicine, pain killers, and everything in between. I have a fear of doctors (no offense) so I decided to search some home remedies. I've never heard of using cayenne to cure sore throats but I decided to give it a try. I put 1/4 tsp. cayenne and 2 tbsp. honey in 1/2 cup warm water and drank it straight. My throat did burn for a while but it felt much better. I did the same right before bed and was able to fall asleep faster than I had in the past few nights. The next morning, my throat felt 90% better so I drank it again and in a few hours, the pain was gone! I know I'll definitely be sharing this remedy!

I put about 1/4 tsp. in a 1/2 cup of warm water and gargled it, repeating about four times over the course of the day. Each time offered some relief, and I woke up this morning with no sore throat.

I found this site via digg.com and honestly did _not_ want to try cayenne pepper in anything. I do not like spicy/hot foods. But my sore throat hurt so much I was willing to try almost anything. I added it to my honey-lemon tea, along with some fresh honey and it really helped. It really stung, as I added too much cayenne [1/2 tsp in 1 cup of tea - should have used 1/4 tsp], but it *really* helped and I was able to eat again. So, I added a little cayenne pepper powder and some ginger powder to some hot soup and now my throat feels a lot better. Thank you so much!

I was so excited about this remedy and was really hoping it would work. My husband and son had both been sick, and I finally caught whatever they had. As soon as I started gettind the sore throat, I started drinking apple cider vinegar (8oz hot water, 1 TBSP ACV, 2 TBSP honey) When that didn't help it (which it usually does) I came to this website and tried the cayenne pepper remedy. First, I tried gargling 1/4 tsp. cayenne in 4oz of warm water with honey. That felt similar to spraying the back of my throat with chloraseptic spray, but went away within five minutes or so. After that, I tried drinking it. I added 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper to my normal ACV mix, but again...short term relief only. I've been doing this for three days now, and my throat feels horrible. Hopefully I'll find something else that works for me.

I see no reason that cayenne pepper would not block pain receptors for a sore throat. One should be careful because a percentage of people have an adverse reaction where the throat could start to swell and make breathing difficult.

I have been struggling with a horrible sore throat that makes talking, eating, existing hard. It's 2am right now and I've seen this hour for several nights because I've been up with a painful throat. I've gargled with apple cider vinegar for a day and a half, taken a drugstore shelf of other options and was going to the doctor tomorrow. I'm not a fan of spicy food so I was hugely leary of putting cayanne pepper in my tea, but I figured at this point it couldn't hurt worse. Amazing! I've drank half of my tea and my throat is almost feeling back to normal. I"m so very grateful I feel like calling everyone I know (at 2am) to tell them of this wonderful cure. Since they won't care right now, I'm sharing with you. Try it!
6529	111	7418	Christine from Cleveland, Ohio	2008-06-30 00:00:00	BETTER BUT NOT CURED	2	0	I went ahead and tried the cayenne and water (three shakes of cayenne into a cup of water). It definitely numbed the area, but about 20 minutes later the pain came back so I figured, oh well, guess it didn't work for me. But I woke up the next morning and the sore throat was totally gone. Don't know if it's a coincidence (I'd only had a sore throat for three days), but you can be sure the next sore throat I get I'll be trying the cayenne again!

I have had the worst sore throat ever for the past week and have been to the hospital twice for pain meds, antibiotics, fluids, and steroids. These things only gave me temporary relief from my huge, painful, white-spotted, puss-covered, swollen tonsils. I tried gargling tons of super salty hot water which made me feel alright for about 30 seconds afterward. I am soo hungry and thirsty because I haven't been able to eat or drink much of anything for the past few days! I was ready to give up and just pluck the suckers out myself when I came across this site with the cayenne pepper cure... I tried it right away! I used about 1/8 tsp of cayenne pepper, a few squirts of lemon and warm water and gargled about 8 times. I felt relief right away and a great tingling sensation. The pepper wasn't spicy at all so i kicked it up a knotch and got even better results! This is AMAZING!!! Tip - between each gargle I stirred the cayenne pepper a little bit because it seemed to float at the top...

I tried the cayenne pepper, I made homemade lemonade plus added the juice with 1 lemon to it, and boiled it with 2 tablespoons of honey, then put it in a cup and added 1/8 of a teaspoon of cayenne pepper, and sipped slowly and my sore throat was gone in 3 sips.

So I decided to mix them together! This time I made chicken and dumplings with lots of broth and red pepper (but I do love hot food) The salt and red pepper defiantly helped with soreness and the heat from the soup cleared me up, even my swollen lymph nodes went down a tad! Amazing I love it!

Fever went down and I felt much better but I started having really bad sore throat. I tried everything but nothing really worked. I came across your site found cayenne pepper recipe. I tried it every half an hour. I was surprised that it worked so fast. By the afternoon, 70-80% of pain was gone. Thank you.
6535	111	7424	Celena from Harper Woods, MI	2008-04-07 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	4 days of a very sore throat. I went to the Dr today & no strep he said "it's Viral, nothing to do but ride it out." I'm thinking what in the world am I going to do, I have to work tomorrow & can't go like this. So I started surfing the net. I mean i've tried everything cough drops, sucrets, hot tea with lots of lemon & honey, vitiman C, Claritin, gurgling with hot salt water, you name it I tried it. I can not believe this really works, I still have a little bit of soreness but I'm going to stick with it. My sore throat improved dramaticly with just the first try. It is a little hot but the pay off is so worth it. Thank a bunch to all who left comments. When I first found this I thought everyone was crazy, but I thought what's the worst that could happen, that my mouth would be on fire for a little bit. Thanks!!
6536	111	7425	Adrian from London, England	2008-03-30 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I tried the Cayenne Pepper remedy yesterday, i was getting very tired from lack of sleep, pain killers were not helping. I thought i'd try, it would take a week to get a docs appoinment and for a sore throat!! Off to the shops i went and came back with Cayenne Poweder and some honey. I must have gargled 8 times yesterday, i didn't really feel much at first but i had read a comment saying stick with it. It was like gargling spicy soup. The last time last night it did feel slightly better and i had a good sleep. 3 times today i have gargled and the nagging pain is getting better. I had a bad ache down the side of my neck from my ear which has gone and i still have a slight sore throat, but its on its way out! I am pleased and will keep a pack of powder for future bad throats, i'm glad it helped. I used a good 1/4 teaspoon of powder and good squeese of honey. A couple of times with lemon juice. Warm water and swollowed a little bit as people have been saying but gargled the rest. My advice, give it a go and keep doing it, stick with it for 2 days and it'll help!

The solution left a tingling feeling in my throat - when this started to ease I flushed my throat again with the solution. I repeated this routine for the next 2 hours & I am now completely free of pain. Thank you to all those who took the time to give feedback - cayenne pepper is a winner!

They did no help, i tried everything from lozengers, tea, and pain medication. I came across this site and read the cayenne pepper remedy...at first i felt no relief, so i repeated the process of about a pinch of cayenne and hot water about 4 times before going to bed...i woke up in complete relief! I cannot believe the change in my throat. I will now skip the doctor and go straight to this remedy...THANK YOU!!!
6540	111	7429	Soon-to-be-mom from Riverside, California	2008-02-28 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I'm currently 23 weeks pregnant and don't have a whole lot of options when it comes to cures. I've had the worst sore throat for the last couple days. I haven't slept much due to the pain. I found this sight and decided "What the heck?" I figured the worst that could happen is it wouldn't work. So I mixed about 1/8 tsp. of cayenne with about 8oz. water and gargled until the glass was empty. My sore throat isn't gone yet but I'm sure that if I keep it up it will be soon. I've only done 1 glass and i am already able to swallow without cringing. In between I'm using salt water which helps with the slight burning on my tongue. Next time I might try the spray bottle idea.
6541	111	7430	Kelly from Colorado Springs, Colorado	2008-02-25 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Well, after 2 visits to the doctor in 5 days due to a SEVERE sore throat with sores and white spots, I really thought I had strep throat. I tested negative both times, but my throat was so sore that I sat on my couch and cried. I haven't slept in 3 nights because it's just getting more and more worse, even after going to the store and buying $20 worth of medicines for colds and sore throats. I gargled with salt water, took 3 kinds of throat drops, ate ice cream to let it slide down my throat for any relief that I could get. Nothing worked. I even used a sinus rinse that you can buy in Walmart to cleanse out my sinuses. Still, nothing worked. Then thinking I was doomed to be sick forever (it seems like that when your miserable), I googled sore throat remedies and found this website. I, like everyone else, was sick and tired of being sick and tired and looking for SOME form a relief. I went ahead and tried the warm water and cayenne straight up since I felt I couldn't possibly feel any worse, and it WORKED! IT REALLY WORKS! I plan on keeping it up until it's totally gone, but I'm feeling like my old self again! I betcha by tomorrow I'll feel like going outside! My husband is in another state at the moment, but he's got the same thing that I have, so I told him and he's on his way to the store right now! Thank you so VERY, VERY MUCH for this LIFE SAVING information!

Anyway, my throat was hurting me very very badly. It felt like someone stuck a size 11 shoe with spikes down my throat. I was thinking about going to the hospital for antibiotics but instead thought perhaps I should search for a natural cure before spending hundreds of dollars. Sure enough I found your site and saw the comments about cayenne pepper. It just so happens that I have a bottle of ______ cayenne solution in my cabinet. So I gargled and sipped a bit and I can feel a bit of relief when I swallow. It's only been about 10 minutes since I did it and I an feel a difference. I will continue to do it throughout the day and see if makes the soreness go away completely
6543	111	7432	Mike from Los Angeles, California	2008-02-15 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Terrible sore throat past couple of day. Same symptoms as many others here: pain kept me awake all night, felt like I swallowed razor blades. Tried benzocaine/menthol throat lozenges (basically useless). Tea with honey and lemon(better). Then I thought I'd look up some home remedies and came across this site. I didn't have any cider vinegar on hand so I thought I'd give the cayenne mixed with warm water gargle remedy a try. I ended up mixing a 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne in a 1/2 cup of hot water, which I let cool to warm. The thought of gargling with red hot pepper tea to cure what felt like a throat full of razor blades seemed very scary, but it ended up not being as bad as it sounds. And it worked!
6544	111	7433	kimberly from san marcos, california	2008-02-11 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I tried the cayenne pepper in tea remedy, and i've only drank one cup of tea so far, but it's a LOT easier to swallow! i can drink water again without wishing someone would take my throat away and give me a new one! i made a cup of lemon & ginger tea (my roommate has teabags of it), put a little less than 1/8 tsp of cayenne pepper in, and about one tsp of honey. i'm definitely going to be drinking that tea again today! (i think i'll wait a little bit, though, because it is kinda spicy)

It start as something viral and led into a sinus infection. Just when I thought the worst was over I woke up with a sore throat that felt like razor blades when I spoke or swallowed. I also had sores which is why I was little scared. I didn't have cayenne but had a mexican bottled hot sauce.Its made from chile arbol. I put a couple drops (1 tsp) in a cup of warm water and gargled six times. just tried it 30 min ago and its working well. The sore that felt like a ball already seems smaller. Go for it and adjust the heat to what you can stand.

I took amoxicillin that I had in my medicine cabinet, halls drops, warm soup, NOTHING HELPED. I even resorted to eating a chain of ice pops just to get some relieve, but it was a no go. I then decided to rush to the emergency room as soon I saw the sun, but then I googled "Sore Throat Cures" and came to this site. I browsed through the testimonials, skeptically, all the while rubbing my ENFLAMED throat...Finally, in desperation, I thought: "Let me try it! I have nothing to lose and possibly everything to gain.

Well the one pain I can't stand is a sore throat! (Sad I know.) So as I was Google searching sore throat remedy's, I came across this site. I saw a lot of people say "cayenne and water", so I decided to try it. What I did was take a little under 1/8 of a TEASPOON of cayenne pepper and 1/2 a cip of warm water. Just mix that together and gargul. I thought to myself "This is going to burn like CRAZY!!" But amazingly enough it helped more than it burned!!! The only thing is your tounge feels a litle funky after you do it. Other than that, I would just like to say thank you to the people who posted it on this website!!

Yesterday I couldn't take it anymore and decided to fight this thing. I have used jalapenos in the past, so I opened a fresh jar, dumped some in my blender, and after processing, just warmed some tortilla chips in the oven and started dipping. That gave me some more energy, where I was able to move around and didn't want to sleep all of the time, but it didn't help the sore throat.

I was not ready to believe it, how something like hot chilly powder can cure a throat. I was apprehensive but desperate and I decided to give it a try knowing it will worsen my condition, not telling anyone for the fear of people calling me an idiot. First time reaction 'am I really feeling a bit different. Still I kept at it for a few more times ( I am bit on the adventures side, like experimenting with myself and off-course desperate in need of relief ).Next morning I was positive I was feeling a bit better. It didn't go away took almost three days to finally cure me. It worked, why, how I still don't know a coincidence may be but how it can be that it gradually worked after every treatment. It is still very hard to believe but thank god I tried it and IT WORKED.

So in desperation I searched the net and found this site. Off to the shop and brought the cayenne pepper and mixed 1/2 tsp in a glass of water and within 20 minutes I had some relief. I did this a few time till I was able to go to sleep. I started to gargle with 1/8 tsp the next day every 30 minutes. By the time I arrived at the doctors it was so much better I told her I did not need the medication. Thank you Delia in Australia
6555	111	7444	Angela from Cincinnati, Ohio	2007-12-05 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I'm finally on my way to some much needed sleep after 4 days but first I had to say THANK YOU! A little background: I've been sick for 5 days with a horrible sore throat, chills, fever, body aches etc. Doctor said it's sinus infection turned bacterial and gave me antibiotics. After 36 hours on the meds and no relief, the sore throat was only getting worse. Hot honey tea wasn't even helping me. I haven't eaten in 5 days - not ANYTHING. Just fluids because of my sore throat and even swallowing tea or water was starting to kill me. I've never tried a 'natural remedy' before in my life having grown up in a medical family where antibiotics were always the cure. Even though I do well with spicy food, I decided to try the honey/lemon/cayenne trick. It didn't taste bad at all. I probably even used less than 1/8 tsp because I'm scared. The first time didn't offer me too much relief. I tried it a few hours later and right after, I was bummed because again no relief. After 15 minutes of looking at your site to see what I've done wrong, I realize that my throat can swallow again!!! This is fantastic. I'm going to continue this for a few days and tell everyone I know about earthclinic.com (Including my doctor who is actually very much a lover of home remedies) Thank you so much to all the people who gave detailed information. I will continue the antibiotics to hopefully rid the fever and infection but this is a huge step for me! I can't wait to sleep and eat tomorrow!

I have tried evrything under the sun including salt water, but nothing has lessened the pain. I went out and picked up some cayenne pepper. I've been gargling every 15 min with 1/2 tsp in a 1/2 cup warm water. This has definitely made it easier to swallow and it's only been 45 min! I'm also not a fan of spicy foods, but after gargling, I recommend rinsing your mouth with cold water. This will take away the burning sensation quickly.

I had been using honey in green tea, zinc lozenges, echinachea and Tylonol Extra for pain... I tried 1/2 cup green tea, 1 tsp. lemon juice (bottled on hand), 1 tsp. honey and 1/8 or 1/4 tsp of cayenne!! It's only been less than 10 minutes and Boy what a difference!! The hotter you can stand the temperature & 'heat' from the cayenna, the better!! Wow!! It works.

6560	111	7449	Jason from Pleasanton, CA	2007-11-02 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I felt the onset of a sore throat last Friday night. Saturday I woke up with it, and it returned before I went to sleep that night. Sunday I Googled "sore throat remedy," and found this site. I got the cayenne that day. It absolutely worked from the start for me. My sore throat never reached a point of intolerability thanks to the cayenne. First I tried it as directed. I microwaved a glass of water. Measured out an 1/8th of a teaspoon. Dropped it in. The steam made me cough a little, and the smell reminded me of tobasco, but in trying out gargling I learned that neither the spicyness nor the taste were unbearable. In fact, since I'd prefer not to gargle, I took to sipping it instead. In the following days I tried it out in coffee, and tea, and water of varying temperatures. It always worked. I never measured past that first time. I just sprinkled the pepper in like I'd salt my eggs or something. My throat never got worse, and it was totally cured by Thursday. Five days is very bearable for a sore throat that is kept to a mere irritation through using the cayenne. I will always keep cayenne handy in the future. For me, this beat sprays, lozenges, and salt water hands down.

I took 1/2 cup of warm water with 3/4 teaspoon of cayenne with honey and lemon mixed in. Drank it and felt so much better thereafter. Afterwards, I followed up with 2 teaspoons of cayenne in half cup warm water and gargled. This remedy is terrific.

I was struck with a sore throat about a week ago. My doc told me there was nothing he could do and the pharmasist told me to gargle asprin. I was panicking about singing when I googled a sore throat cure and tried the Cayanne Pepper immediately. It worked a charm and I was able to sing every note with ease. It might just be my secret weapon in the future! Any singers out there, this really does work!

Today is the 3rd day and I felt better this morning than I did the previous two mornings by a long shot. I have certainly had some strange looks when folks ask what I'm drinking but it doesn't taste bad and it REALLY does help! Thanks!

I wasn't quite sure of this but I tried the cayenne in hot water. well, I had crushed red pepper flakes that I put in a tea ball in the hot water. I gargled this then spit most of it out and swallowed just a tiny bit. It's a bit hot but nothing major. I noticed immediate but short lived relief. I have been gargling every half an hour or so. I am amazed that this actually works! It's worth a try if you have a bad throat.

I used just a bit less than 1/8 of a tsp and it wasn't spicy at all (and I'm a wuss when it comes to spicy). I'll recommend this to everyone.
6568	111	7457	Catie from Lewisville, Texas	2007-09-01 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I took Al from Malaysia's advice and tried the chili pepper version because I don't have cayenne on hand and couldn't muster up the energy to pile the kids in the car to go get some. First let me say that I believe my sore throat is allergy related. It's hard to take anything to help my "scratchy" throat without putting myself to sleep, being that all allergy medicine has antihistimine. That being said, I generously sprinkled the chili pepper into my coffee, and it didn't taste that bad. Then I got brave and warmed up about 1/2 c. of water, a squirt of generic honey, and 1/8 tsp. of chilli pepper. That went down surprisingly easy. Plus, before I even finished my cup of warm water I was beginning to feel a difference. Thank you Earth Clinic!

6570	111	7459	Alyssa from Bull Valley, Illinois	2007-08-30 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I, like a lot of people, am absolutely miserable when I have a sore throat. Last night I could feel I had a sore throat coming on so I drank a cup of lemon tea with honey, but I woke up at 4 a.m. with a terrible sore throat. Miserably I tried to sleep, but I couldn't... The worst part was that this is the last weekend of summer vacation and I had some really big plans with my friends which I would not be able to fully enjoy if i had a sore throat, bugging me everytime I talked, swallowed, ate, or drank. So I googled sore throat remedies and this website came up. I scanned through it and thought, "pepper? no way!" but I was desperate so I ran out to the store and got a tiny little shaker of cayenne ground red pepper. I paid 4 bucks for that little thing, but I was so desperate. I got home and warmed up a mug of water and put a tiny spoonful of the pepper in. The water turned an icky red and I was afraid to drink it... but I knew I had to try it, I mean like 200 other people posted here and said it worked great, so I gargled a little bit. Besides my mouth burning, my throat was the same, if not worse. So I tried swallowing a little and my throat burned terribly. I was annoyed that I believed that it would actually work, but than a couple minutes later, the pain in my throat was reduced by like 75%! I was so happy! I'm going to drink a little of this every 15 minutes to keep my throat nice and pain free! Tonight I'll drink some Theraflu (helps all cold symptoms) mixed with blueberry tea, and a little bit of the pepper. Hopefully it will be gone by morning. Thanks so much earthclinic.
6571	111	7460	Sean from Charleston, SC	2007-08-30 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Gargling with Cayenne Pepper helped my sore throat immensely. I put together James from Georgia's concoction to further help my throat and and never in my life have I been more afraid to drink something. It does taste like I am drinking the wing sauce straight but it has rid me of much phlegm and aided my sore throat. My throat still burned a bit but once it went away so did most of the pain in my throat as well as some congestion.
6572	111	7461	Eric from Ontario, Canada	2007-08-17 00:00:00	NAY	1	0	The Cayenne pepper remedy did not work at all for me I have tried it several times over the past year and has about as much effect as throat losenges. If you have a really really sore throat the only way to cure it is antibiotics trust me I went 3 weeks with a horendous sore throat before giving in and within 3 days I was cured there more expensive but so worth the money.

It wasn't and I was told to wait it out. I had to find another option and came across your website and the Cayenne Pepper gurgle. I like Cayenne so it wasn't a stretch. I did 2 Gargles the first night and then maybe 2 times a day as needed for the next 2 days and my sore throat was gone! It did take a 2-3 days to completely work but it did! Amazing - I'm telling everyone I know about this!

I couldn't leave work, so I asked around if anyone had cayenne pepper. My boss handed me a little container of crushed red pepper flakes, which I threw in a cup of hot water and gargled. I have a high tolerance for spice, so I actually enjoyed the burn, but I could also feel it working fairly quickly. Swallowing hurts a lot less just a half-hour later!

I used my old stand by Listerine but the next day the pain was still there. I tried different rhemedies for three days with no success. Then I found your website and tried 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne powder in 1/2 glass of warm water every 30 minutes. When I went to bed I still had pain but when I awoke in the morning it was like I had a new throat. Cayenne Pepper cured my sore throat. No pain and no temperature, thanks.

I tried it about 7 or so times in less then 2 days and it really didnt do to much I am still in a good amount of pain.

6580	111	7469	Luis from New York, NY	2007-07-23 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	So I've been having a sore throat for the last 6 days. Today saw a doctor and she prescribed Zithromax 5 day treatment. We'll see. However, the pain I have in my throat is terrible and I can't swallow. 3 advils do not help. So I came here and found the Cayenne Pepper Water gargle thing. I went, took 1 teaspoon into 1/2 cup warmish water. the first few gargles went well.. Im used to spicy food so the tongue thing didn't worry me. But my throat pain is deeper than the gargle hits. So the last round I let some of the solution drop deeper into my throat. When it came into contact with whatever is irritated, my entire head caught fire. I had extraordinary pain from my throat through my ears and I was tearing and shaking uncontrollably, gripping my sink with both hands....I howled from the pain. it took a good 5 minutes and deep breathing to calm down. Basically, I maced myself it seems. This did nothing for the pain in my throat either, only, it showed me that the infection does in fact radiate to my ears. Now I will wait for the antibiotic to kick in I think. Im still shaken up by it but I think I'll survive.

I made a simple solution of 1 tablesppon of pepper ( cayenne ) one tbl spook of salt, mixed together in hot/warm water and gargled, maybe about 5 or 6 times, every 30 mins or so, and presto gone. I had to write in as all the medication and antobotics in the world did nothing but this worked! amazing.
6583	111	7471	Jason from Boulder, Colorado, USA	2007-07-08 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	This remedy is amazing. This remedy (cayenne pepper and water, gargle it and swallow a tiny bit) is the best sore throat cure I've ever found. I woke up last night with a terrible pain in my throat and couldn't swallow. I gargled with this mixture for about 15 minutes and went back to bed. I didn't feel amazing at first, but at least I was feeling a little better and was able to go to sleep. I woke up 8 hours and my throat felt basically totally cured. I am truly amazed, thanks so much for sharing such a great cure! Also, a few weeks ago in the same situation I tried the apple cider vinegar/cayenne pepper/water/honey remedy and found it worked decently but not as good as the cayenne pepper/water remedy. Thanks for the amazing help!

Anyhow I have felt like crap all day and decided to look up some info on how to fix or even get rid of my sore throat quick like. I'm goin home for a week during the 4th of July and I don't want to be sick when I get there. So I tried the Cayenne Pepper and needless to say I'm impressed! It hasn't taken it away but it has made it feel ten times better than it did. I will do this again before bed and then when I wake in the mornin. I honestly don't believe in things like this but it really does work :)

It's only been fifteen minutes. My throat is still a little sore so I will do another rinse soon but I can't believe how much better it feels already. I always drink a glass of water in the morning and it hurt to much to do it earlier but I am doing it now (there is only a little burning in my mouth from the pepper but it is not bad) Thank you for your help and I truly appreciate this site.

I tried it 30 minuted ago and so far nadda! Even tried sipping it and still nadda. The burning tends to dissipate after a few attempts though..probably numb tongue or something, but my throat/glands are still screaming! I'm afraid this remedy will do no more than warm tea and honey in my opinion. Save your self the aggravation and ribbing on this one people!

Well I wanted to nip it in the bud as soon as I could so I came across this site. On my lunch break I went home and gargled with cayenne pepper in warm water (5 shakes!) and also painted iodine on my inner wrists. I thought both would never work. Well its now 2 hours later and I feel 90 percent better. I won't say 100% because that would be a lie... but it most certainly did help!!! I will always do these remedies from now on. Thanks much.

I was about to break into my pain killer stash, but knew that won't be a good idea while taking care of my 3 month old son... so I came across this site, gave it a shot, and wow...

After my last pill this past Saturday my Throat started to tingle and one of my glands started to feel a little swollen and I would feel it when I would swallow.

I'm in a musical production in which I have a solo that requires me to sing with all of the power I can muster in my voice. Opening night is tonight and at last night's dressed rehearsal, my song (which had been fairly easy for me to sing) was very difficult because of my throat. Starting to freak out when it had worsened this morning, I searched online and found this site. I was leery at first, but decided to try it. The cayenne pepper gargle helped immediately (though it did burn a bit, it was worth it) and I plan to take tea with cayenne to my show tonight.

But I have been to the Dr and still have this nagging sore throat the Dr put me on a Z-Pak and now I am almost done with my second one all of my other symptoms (fever, aching, general crap like feeling) are gone except for this pesky sore throat. It is horrible in the mornings. I go up this morning and started searching the net for a way to get rid of or ease the pain. I stumbled onto here thought yet right but I tried it anyway. To Leslie in Floride I think it was thank you I had no cayenne powder but I did have those little pizza red pepper flakes. I put about half a packet of those in a about 8 oz water let it sit for a minute and started gargling. Afterwards I could swallow for the first time with no pain in weeks. And I started coughing up rather easily the crude that takes me an hour to get up (sorry that is gross but it you have a sore throat you know what I mean). I will continue this for a few more days but the instant relief is worth the first try. Thanks so much!

My wife's sore throat was so painful I'm sure she would have licked a poisonous frog if someone claimed it worked. Then we stumbled upon the "cayenne pepper remedy"! We used another user's recipe of a teaspoon of cayenne pepper in 12oz of water. After 5 gargles of this red concoction, she exclaimed in excited disbelief that it was working!! A by-product of gargling this brew was lips and tongue of fire! She quelled the burn with a cool glass of milk after she had gargled as much as she could stand. I'm soo glad that it worked because now my baby can get to sleep! Yahoo!!

I spent the whole night sipping water and suffering. I spent all day at work with a sore throat and swollen sinuses. When I got home I naturally got online and googled "sore throat". Somehow I found your site and started reading the testimonials on cayenne gargle and tomato tea. I tried the cayenne gargle first and was totally amazed at how much better I felt. After gargling with the cayenne numerous times I decided to try inhaling a bit of salt water. I am now sitting here feeling like myself again and sipping tomato tea. Thank you so much for creating this website and posting these wonderful home remedies!

It worked. Instantly I felt SO MUCH better. Like it wasnt painful to breathe as much. Thank you for your amazing website! Now I'm going to try the egg whites for fevers.

I woke at 4am this morning and gargled with salt water and hydrogen peroxide, but it did nothing for the hellish pain. I was desperate to get rid of it, but I am refusing to take any kind of drug anymore. When I saw Cayenne pepper as a cure, I thought it was going to be so painful I couldn't do it--because of the spiciness. It worked so freakin well, I just drink it now. And the sore throat is nearly gone after 20 minutes.

(antibiotic did not work fast enough)...too the point that when I cough my muscles in my stomach aches already.. Googled sore throat remedy and found this site. Ran to the supermarket at 10PM and bought McCormmick's ground cayene pepper for under 4 bucks. Microwaved a glass of water, mixed half a tablespoon of cayenne powder.. gargled about 6 times in 5 minutes.. like others noted..cayenne caused minor discomfort/senasation in mouth.. rinsed mouth with water.. AND UNBELIEVABLE RESULT WITHIN 15 MINUTES... throat soreness was gone.. nostrils cleared up..and slept through the night. By the way..I tried this 3 nights ago just to make sure I don't have any side effects or something negative before I write this. This thing worked for me.. and hope it works for you , too. Thanks to the person who "invented: this.

In total desparation and after three days, I tried gargling 1 tsp cayenne pepper with warm water. I was telling my wife how it did not work when, all of the sudden, all that awful phlem came right up, and I blew the rest of that green crud right out my nose. Then I tried the ACV, heated to breath the vapors, then gargled. For the first time in days, my throat felt okay! It instantly took away 80%  of the discomfort. Thank God for this web page!

I felt like gagging, which is something I do NOT like to do. I went online and found your site. After reading all the results from Cayenne Pepper I decided to try it. Luckily my girlfriend is a great cook and she had some in the cabinet. I could not believe what a difference it made! Immediately after sipping my throat felt almost back to normal. I have been doing it now on and off for about an hour and I can not thank you guys enough. Now I look forward to trying the Apple Cider Vinegar method for my high blood pressure.

Last night I felt like I was coming down with a cold, so I dipped my favorite citric fruit, pineapple, slices in Cayanne peppr before I went to bed. In the morning, I didn't have a cold at all! The Cayanne pepper unclogged my noseand opened up my lungs. Thanks to this amazing cure, I can go to school today!

My 5 yr old daughter keeps acquiring the cold bug after every couple of weeks. Often times, her cold requires an anntibiotic as a last resort and lot of absent days from school. However, in my quest for a better and a natural alternative, I came across this website. I decided to follow the advice for using ceyenne pepper for the sore throat and H2O2 for her cold. Viola!! Miracle. Since she is only 5 yrs, she could not really gargle, however, she was able to take a sip of ceyenne pepper water, and while holding her breath she held her neck back for a couple of seconds. This way the ceyenne pepper liquid could actually stay in contact with her throat for a couple of a seconds at a time. She felt a lot better after the remedy, and was actually able to go to school this morning.
6615	111	7503	Sandra from Cheyenne, WY	2007-04-16 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I saw on your site how many 'yeahs' were received for using cayenne pepper to help a sore throat, after waking up at 2:00 am and not being able to swallow without pain. I mixed 1/2 tsp with 1/3 cup warm water and gargled until I was tired of gargling. I was able to swallow without pain directly after that, it was that fast! I'm thankful to have found something, even later in life, that keeps me from having that awful feeling of not wanting to swallow due to soreness. Thanks so much for your site!

My sore throat is still a bit sore, but not anywhere near how sore it was. This remedy works very very well.

After reviewing everyone's comments on here I mixed 2TBSP honey with a squeeze of fresh lemon and mixed it all with hot water. I think decided to put a teaspoon of acv as well as cayenne pepper into it. I've been sipping it for about 10 minutes now and I'm starting to notice some relief. =)
6619	111	7507	Patrick from Aurora, IL	2007-04-14 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Ok, put me in the huge skeptic group. I went to bed with a minor sore throat and woke up during the night with a very painful sore throat. It kept me up for most of the rest of the night. I got up this morning and started searching for remedies. I found this one and thought I would give it a try. I enjoy hot foods so I thought I would kick up the strength a bit. Others recomended 2 tsp/8 oz of water. I increased it to 1 tbsp/8 oz of water. I gargeled 2 oz and immediately realized that I may have used a little too much cayenne. I only did this for about 30 seconds. Right now my throat feels COMPLETELY 100% BETTER!! From now on, I will no longer go to the medicine cabinet but rather the spice cabinet for a sore throat remedy.
6620	111	7508	Crystal from Elkins, WV	2007-04-14 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Pepper remedy!!!!! 3 to choose from!!! This morning I woke up with a wretched sore throat! I have to go out tonight with some of my friends so I decided to google a remedy. The truth is Cayenne pepper and both crushed red pepper flakes WORK WONDERS! I ran out of cayenne so I substituted with red pepper flakes! I am telling you after gargling about 5 times I feel completely better! Also, I ate a few fresh jalapeno peppers to get down my throat and this worked extremely well!! After gargling I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND EATING A FEW JALAPENOS.....IF THEY ARE REALLY HOT THEY WILL DO THE JOB!!!!

6622	111	7510	R from Irvine, CA	2007-04-09 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I've had a sore throat for 2 days now and it has reached the point of becoming unbearable. So, I decided to try Cayenne pepper and it instantly cured my sore throat. I put two teaspoons of Cayenne pepper in a cup and filled it with warm water. Then gargled for 15 seconds each, and spit out.. I also swallowed a tiny amount. I kept doing this until my tongue started feeling the burning sensation. As a suggestion, I recommend keeping milk in your mouth until the burning sensation disappears. Milk is a base that counteracts the acid of the pepper.
6623	111	7511	Verne from Seattle, WA	2007-04-08 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have never looked on the internet for a cure for sore throat till this week when I was ready to go to the doctor after 5 days of swollen glands and pain. Found this site in the middle of the night after gargling warm salt water, peroxide etc. The Cayenne pepper mixed with warm water, I went to bed and could sleep and sore throat was gone by mid morning . Thanks
6624	111	7512	Leslie from Miami, Florida	2007-04-07 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Hello, I started feeling really bad yesterday. I was running a fever and had the body aches but no sore throat. I took the dayquil and and fell asleep and when I woke up this morning my body aches were gone as well as my fever but I have the worst sore throat ever. I can hardly swallow without cringing and almost crying. I decided to search the internet for home remedies and I cam across this website. I was reading the comments and was immediately thinking this will not work for me. I continued with my morning and then came back to read more comments and decided to try it out. I did not have any cayenne pepper but I had crushed red pepper. I put a good amount of crused red pepper flakes in some warm water and gargled the whole cup, and I could start to feel the pain going away when I was gargling. I finished the cup and then made some hot tea with honey and lemon. I can tell you at this point, I feel better but the pain is still there but not as prevalent as before I started the gargling technique. I am going to continue gargling with the peppers and water as well as the honey and lemon tea and I will see how it makes me feel. I will keep you posted. Thank you for this website!

6627	111	7515	Kristi from Fredericksburg, VA	2007-04-02 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Hot wings are my method of making my throat feel better. Not sure that it 'cures' the sore throat, but it numbs the pain (probably like cayenne)...and lets you heal whatever ailment you have without the pain; plus, the chicken gives you nourishment while you probably have a lack of appetite for other foods. I always take a teaspoon of salt mixed with warm water and gargle at least 3 times before bedtime, also. Usually it helps and I feel better the next day...only once has this not worked out, but then Ibuprofen always does the trick!!
6628	111	7516	Julie from Marlborough, Massachusetts	2007-04-02 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I've had the worst sore throat for three days, and since I recently changed doctors my new doctor was not going to be able to see me for at least a week (call me impatient, but there's no way i can sit around in this kind of pain for over a week). so i checked out this site, and i tried the cayenne pepper cure. I added my own twist to it, I took a can of tomato soup and added a very large amount of cayenne pepper, plus some crushed red pepper flakes and some powdered garlic. it stung like the dickens going down, but less than two hours later i feel so much better. i could barely swallow anything this morning, it hurt so bad i was almost in tears, i can't believe this made me feel so much better in such a short amount of time. i'm going to keep drinking the soup and cayenne pepper and see how everything goes. thank you!!!

6631	111	7519	Brian from Cirencester, UK	2007-03-26 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I wouldn't call it a 'cure' but a very good relief. I had a terrible sore throat but gargling with 1tsp of cayenne in a tumbler of warm water for as long as I could stand took away the pain COMPLETELY for up to about an hour and a half. My throat went in a couple of days but I put that down to me fighting the bugs off. If you find the burning sensation on the lips too much, try a milk drink or yoghurt after gargling. I'll be heading for the spice rack next time I get a sore throat for sure.
6632	111	7520	Jenn from Chicago, IL	2007-03-25 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have had terrible pain in my throat for almost 4 days now. The worst part is, it's spring break! I have plans to go to the dells with my best friend tomorrow and I would hate to cancel that. I have already had to cancel movie nights with my friends because of my sore throat. So at last I Googled "Sore Throat Cures" and this site came up! This was the first time I've ever heard of this remedy, but I decided to give it a try because the doctor prescription certainly did nothing. I've only gargled 3 times now, but my throat seems 50% better within 35 minutes or so! Now I don't have to cringe every time I have to swallow or eat something. Thank you so much, now I can go on a trip of a lifetime! Love you guys!

Decided to google "sore throat remedy" this morning and found your site. I ran out at lunch and bought some organic ceyenne pepper and bottled water. I mixed 1 tsp of ceyenne with 12 oz of water and gargled about five times. Believe it or not, my sore throat is already almost gone. Great remedy! Now I'm going to try the ACV for HBP. Thanks!
6636	111	7524	Girish from Chicago, IL	2007-03-20 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Here is why (I think) Cayenne Pepper works: Cayenne Pepper contains Capsaicin - which known to us for long time as a great pain killer. When one gargles with pepper powder, capsaicin overloads the nerve endings in the throat giving instance relief from the pain. If you gargle on a regular basis then the nerves are overloaded and you don't feel pain. Capsaicin is used in chronic pain management exactly for same reason. I don't think it has any curative qualities in this case (like getting rid of the actual infection), but the pain relief is great!

When I got back from my vacation I still had the sore throat so I came online and searched some home remedies. I came across this one and just read it because I thought it was a joke. But I began to read all the comments and how it worked so well for everyone. So I thought, why not give it a shot. I went out and bought honey, C. Pepper, and white vinegar. Came home and gargled every 15 minutes for the night, and to my shock my sore throat was gone...I couldnt believe it. This stuff is incredible!!!

I have gargled a 1/2 glass of the cayenne pepper with warm water and I feel so much better. I am going to finish the glass. I just have to keep stirring so the cayenne does not stay in the bottom of the glass. Also watch out for a burning mouth. I will say I'll deal with the burning mouth instead of the sore throat. Thank God for this website.

I really need my voice to be in good shape so I did some research for a sore throat cure. I'm currently drinking a cup of black tea with honey, lemon, cayenne pepper (just a little), and sugar (I don't like honey in my tea so this is there for sweetness) and already it feels SO much better! I'll be making another cup before I go tomorrow morning!

I tried to sleep but I couldn't get over the pain, remembering this website from the ACV cure I used for overall health, I searched for sore throats. Coming to the Cayenne page I went downstairs and took 1/2 tsp of powder and 6oz of warm water, gargled and then swallowed, it felt fantastic and I felt almost immediate results, I just woke up and I am taking it again, bye bye sore throat, what a remedy!

Lozenges provided relief for about 2 mins literally & salt and warm water was useless! After 2 attempts on google to find something that wasn't so yucky I found this!! I grabbed my wallet & keys and sped to the store to get the cayenne. I used 1/2 tsp to a glass of warm water & gargled about 4 times. I sipped a bit of it which was PEPPER as heck!! At bedtime my sore throat seemed to get worse...the cayenne was doing its job at that time. Cuz when I woke up my throat was 100% better. I'm still congested but I can deal with that!! Bye bye sore throat!!! Thanks!!

I have been a very healthy person, only getting sick for a day or two a year and have a bad diet/sweet tooth. Today when I got hungry after two days of not eating much I was craving a carls jr buffalow burger(cayenne) and a shake...I felt so good after it for about 2 hours then it got bad again. It was so bad I could not sleep and I feared for my throat to start bleeding, found your site, only thing I had was Frank's Red Hot (chili sauce) so I mixed it with water and now I think I am going to make it through the night as it feels 80% better after three gargles. Thank you, I plan picking up some of the other stuff to try too. Time for sleep

I then tried cayenne gargle, with a little salt. The result is fantastic, almost immediately, my throat was back to normal, no mucus or pain. I now use a gargle mix of cayenne, apple cider vinegar, salt & honey twice daily. I also take cayenne with food. Generally feel very well and am very happy to have got rid of throat problems. I have been doing this regime for 2 weeks now.

I read about gargling hot water with 1/4 tsp of Cayenne Pepper. After I gargled a glassful, my throat wasn't sore. For added benefit, I followed up with a 12 oz. cup of hot water with 2 T. of ACV, 1 tsp. honey and 1/4 tsp. of Cayenne Pepper. The taste was tolerable. My throat felt good afterwards.

I tried gargling 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper in a mug (8oz) hot water, and wow.... I could swallow, I could breathe, the golf ball entirely disappeared, throat felt lubricated. I could eat dinner with my guests as planned, and felt great. The results were so good I kept sipping a tea (same proportions, though the cayenne settles to the bottom) all the next day, still good results. Then yesterday (day 3) I xcountry skied and chatted all day while drinking hot chocolate instead of the cayenne. This morning, sore throat and laryngitis. !! I am back continually sipping the cayenne now and my voice isn't back (I suspect the cayenne cannot get into the larynx unless you drown in it) but my throat is SO much better. Maybe my cayenne is cheap and old (at least a year) so is less spicy than what some others have, but I found 1/4- 1/2 tsp in 1 large mug hot water to be so pleasant I am going to keep drinking it instead of other herbal teas. mmm. Kind of like clamato juice or chili con carne. Apparently it is good for migraines and digestion too, lots of Vitamin a, C and complete B. thanks!!
6656	111	7542	Kitt from Levittown, PA	2007-02-25 00:00:00	NAY	1	0	Tried gargling with cayenne pepper for my miserable sore throat. I have been up all night. My throat is still very sore and I still can't swallow, so I can't say much for the cayenne pepper theory. It DID clear out a lot of mucous though and my sinuses are quite clear! I'll keep trying it for a while longer, but it did nothing for the pain except add a burny feeling to it! Going to try one readers suggestion of ginger next. Bet this would be awesome next time I have a normal head cold though (aside from the taste, yuck!)

I went to google and found this site. Thank god! I did my usual lemon juice and salt but that didn't work. Now I just used the cayanne pepper with water and instant relief. No pain and I will be doing it in the next 15 minutes.

6659	111	7545	Lindsay from Salt Lake City, Utah	2007-02-25 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Ahhh! finally I can eat something without feeling like crying from pain. I have had a really bad sore throat for 3 days now. The back of my throat was red, raw, and looked like it was bleeding. Tried cough drops, otc throat spray, advil, etc and nothing touched the pain. So googled sore throat cure and thankfully this site came up. I alternated gargling the water and cayenne with drinking the ACV, lemon, cayenne, honey, hot water. It is now about an hour after i found this site, my sore throat is much better, not gone yet but tolerable. Thanks
6660	111	7546	Eric from Phoenix, AZ	2007-02-25 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	So I'm sitting here with I think the worst sore throat I have had in my life, reading everyone's comments about the cayenne pepper remedy So I pull out a glass with warm/hot water, dumped some C pepper and started gargling. I'm not going to lie it burned my lips and tongue like no tomorrow. I gargled about 15 mins ago and i can tell a slight relief already. Ill try again shortly. I also had some really bad nasal congestion but that Cayenne pepper is clearing that up too! God I hope this works cause I feel like I'm falling apart!
6661	111	7547	Rick from Grand Rapids, MI	2007-02-25 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I started getting a sore throat yesterday evening around 5:30. I normally chew Zinc or Vitamin C tablets.....but that didn't work this time. I woke up this morning with an incredibly sore throat finding it hard to breathe/talk/eat. I saw this Cayenne pepper & water "cure" and was very skeptical. To my surprise, I've done it five times today, 15 minutes apart, and my sore throat is pretty much GONE. Hopefully it stays away!! Note: I thought the Cayenne pepper and water would be horrible....but it really doesn't taste like anything....just has a little bite to it for an aftertaste. Off to do another round. Take care!

Yesterday I couldn't swallow worth a damn but today i feel much much much better. Its a gross taste though and it made me throw up 1 time lol but I'm fine today. Still sore just a lil bit but it'll be gone before the weekend is over.
6663	111	7549	Andrew from Fort Lauderdale, FL	2007-02-22 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I am so glad I stumbled on this site.. About a week ago I found this site searching for a home remedy for dry and cracked hands and was really taken buy it. In any event, two days ago I went to work and felt really drained and with the onset on a sore throat. I didn't think much of it at the time, but buy the end of my shift I felt really drained and the sore throat was kicking. I had a particular soreness to one side. I came home went to sleep and woke up at the symptoms were worse. By the afternoon I was exhausted and figured some sleep would be good for repair. I woke up aching and still with the sore throat. So, I went on this site and found the cayenne pepper cure and decided to give it a shot. It works, It works, It works... Cast aside your doubts, and fears about home remedies and in particular this one. I started off gargling a full teaspoon mixed with 12 ounces of water repeatedly for 15 minutes. (I mistook the original recipe which said every 15 minutes and did it for 15 minutes straight) It burned and was not fun, but having a sore throat is worse. After that I read it said to gargle every 15 minutes with a 1/4 tea spoon of cayenne in 4oz of water. I did this until I went to bed. In addition I had a few glasses of tea with a little Apple Cider Vinegar (2 table spoons). I woke up this morning and I have no, I mean no sore throat. No fever, no body aches, no headaches.. Nothing.. Absolutely wonderful. My deepest thanks.

So, i was just looking on the internet to see what cures came up. Then, i came across this website! Soon i was off to the shops to buy some cayenne powder! When i had got some i gargled with it every 15 minutes. after the first try it didn't help much but i carried on. About 1/2 hours later my throat is better! i am still gargling though just to make sure it stays that way because it said to use the full glass before you stop. i am so grateful for this website and now i can talk as much as i want! Thank you again so much, Georgia xxxxx

So, then I tried using salsa instead of the c.b. and it worked great. Probably has some additives but tasted better and stayed stirred up better! For what that's worth..... Thanks, I enjoy your site very much.

NEVER IN MY LIFE HAVE I HAD SUCH PHYSICAL PAIN BEFORE INCLUDING KIDNEY STONES AND CHILDBIRTH! I HAVE PACKED MY NECK IN ICE ONE MINUTE, AND HOT THE NEXT...NOTHING WORKS.

I'm gonna try again in the morning, but for now, it's back to bed. I stumbled upon this remedy at 3:30 AM, after waking up due to severe pain. Now I can actually get back to bed! Thanks, Penny!
6673	111	7559	Kelsey from Menifee, CA	2007-02-13 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	After waking up achy and light-headed with flu/cold symptoms, and having it stick for three days I was scrambling around the internet trying to find something to kill the virus off (whatever it was) so that I could go back to work. First I tried the cayenne pepper for my sore throat - miraculous, went away immediately and as of today (day 6) has not come back. I've been taking the ACV once a day and do feel better but I'm not sure if the virus is just running its course or whether the ACV is helping. Then I tried peroxide in the ears - quite uncomfortable but my body aches were gone by the next morning and haven't returned. So I'd give a thumbs up to the peroxide and cayenne for sure.

I was actually in PAIN each time I tried to swallow. I read this website and sent the kids to the store to buy some. I mixed the water and cayenne and so far have gargled three times and it feels a little better, I'll check back tomorrow.

I've barely been able to eat or drink, and my throat has been very raw. I've tried salt water, vitamin C, antibiotics, and anything else I came across. Nothing helped. I came across this site and decided to try the cayenne pepper with warm water. I didn't think there was any way it would actually work, but I figured I had nothing to lose. I gargled every 15 minutes for 45 minutes. I still had a sore throat after the 3rd time, but my daughter woke up from her nap and I had to get her. I noticed about 30 minutes later that my sore throat was gone. I cannot believe it actually worked! I just wish I would have found this sooner. I am so grateful for finding this site.
6679	111	7565	Susan from Paris, TX	2007-02-04 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Cayenne Pepper Remedy for sore throat has worked wonders for me, too! I've been ill with a sore throat since Dec. 20th, and on Jan. 12th, began my THIRD round of antibiotics (different from the first two)and by Jan 24 was still NO better; on that day, I found this site & tried the CAYENNE PEPPER GARGLE--1 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper in 4 oz. of water, gargled with it several times a day. Immediately the pain subsided, and the mucous coating my throat & vocal chords began to loosen. Mixed another glass for that night, repeating the gargling. Today, my throat is MUCH better, and I am no longer hoarse. Gargled again today, will continue for a few more days and now will be able to have my karaoke party Sat. night and sing after all! THIS IS THE GREATEST SORE THROAT CURE I'VE EVER TRIED & I recommend it to everyone! Never will I be without cayenne pepper! Thanks to everyone who gave their feedback, and to this site.
6680	111	7566	Ken from Arlington, VA	2007-02-03 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have been on a home remedy health kick lately. I woke up at 3 a.m. and could feel a sore throat coming on. So I found this site and utilized the information for a sore throat remedy. I always keep cayenne pepper in the house due to ulcers. I mixed a cup of water and a teaspoon of cayenne pepper. Heated it up in the microwave for 1 minute then let it set for 5 minutes for brewing time. Then, as others have done, I gargled with it one mouth full at a time. You will need to keep stirring it since the cayenne will try to settle at the bottom. I would truly hate for anyone to experience a mouthful of just cayenne pepper. This also started the process of sinus drainage. I will post another blog on what I did for the sinus issue. I just wanted to thank everyone for their input. It has saved me a trip to the doctor's office. Thanks..

I used about a teaspoon of Cayenne pepper and microwaved some water for 1 min. and gargled. My lips were on fire for a little bite nothing a couple of ice cubes couldn't help. I will try this in the future. Thanks
6682	111	7568	Rebecca from Stamford, CT	2007-01-25 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have had a severe sore throat since January 6, 2007. On the 8th of January it was so bad, my Husband took me into the emergency room. They did a strep and mono, but was negative. The doctor gave me some antibiotics and pain killers. She said if it is a bacterial, the antibiotics will clear it up. If it is viral, I will just have to let it run it's course. Both she and my Husband said it's common - on the east coast, to get a severe sore throat before getting terrible sick with what feels like the flu. I am originally from Chicago and never seemed to get colds, flu's sore throats, etc. Today I finally finished my antibiotics and sadly, after $168 spent on them, they didn't work. I shy away from taking pain killers because I don't like the "stoned" feeling. Today, at 5:33pm EST I put 1 tsp of Cayenne Pepper into 4oz's of water and although it was hot, my throat is feeling pretty damn good. It's not completely better, but I'm sure with a little more time, I'll be back to my healthy self. Which is a must, I have a 6 month old little gas monster. Since Cayenne seems to be working, maybe I can find something for gassy or as our doctor calls it "colicky" baby. Enjoy the Cayenne Pepper and the New Year everyone. :)

6684	111	7570	Randy from Wddington, NC	2007-01-24 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Went to Disney World last week and feel that I caught a bug on the airplane ride back to Charlotte. Woke up Sunday morning, aching all over and with a sore throat. Stayed on the couch all day and as the day wore on, the sore throat got worse to the point that it was feeling like I couldn't breathe. No better Monday so I called the Dr's office and tried to get an appointment. Couldn't see me until Tuesday at 10:00am. They told me I had a viral infection and that there was not a whole lot they could give me for it. Told me to get some Mucinex and gave me a prescription for some nasal spray. No sleep since Saturday night. Found this site at 5:00am this morning and thought I had nothing to lose. Have gargled three times and swallowed some the last time. Can notice a marked improvement already. Thanks for sharing. The cayenne pepper seems to work!
6685	111	7571	Gwen from Mililani, HI	2007-01-13 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	A week ago I felt a cold coming on and sure enough, I had a sore throat by Monday. Did my usual routine of Claritin, Jamba Juice Coldbuster, salt water gargle, and even Sudafed Cough and Cold. Those OTC remedies helped, but I wanted to annihilate the symptoms before it got worse. I searched on-line for home remedies and tried a couple -- even gargling with Coke. Saw this site, and figured, what the heck. Friday night, gargled with cayenne pepper, vinegar, honey and warm water. It worked and I was ecstatic! Gargled one more time with cayenne and hot water before bed. Got the best sleep ever in that whole week! Searched the site for other remedies for my cough and that worked too. Never going to buy OTC drugs for my cold again! Thanks so much.

My sore throat vanished almost immediately. I could finally swallow without grabbing at my throat! I wasn't brave enough to swallow it, but gargled 1 teaspoon in 4oz. warm water and felt so much better. I am off to take a nap. Thank you!!!

I just spent the last few days without sleep and completely losing my voice until stumbling across this website. Within hours it felt better, not perfect, but within 1 night of a decent amount of sleep the next day I feel great and I have no sore throat. I used about a teaspoon of C pepper in about 4 oz of water and gargled & drank it all night long and so far all day long. no more pain (just congestion).

Saturday I called my doctor,who has no hours but called a prescription of antibiotics to the pharmacy. While waiting for my hubby to get back with the meds I clear out the sinus with my usual saline rinse then gargled with some more warm salt water . My throat was bleeding. I NEEDED something for this NOW. To kill time I googled home remedies. It was So OUTRAGEOUS maybe it would help. DID IT EVER ! ! Within 20 minutes my throat was feeling improved. Gargled every visit to the bathroom ..... and not going to buy chloroseptic spray again. Today (Monday) I'm at work telling EVERYONE about this remedy.
6689	111	7575	Tracy from Charlotte, NC	2007-01-07 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I had been battling a sore throat for two days (Thursday and Friday). On Friday, I decided to research some home remedies for a sore throat online and I came across the cayenne pepper suggestion. Since I knew I had some of this at home, I thought I would give it a try. Reading the other testimonials also sold me. I gargled using a 4 ounce glass of warm water and cayenne pepper (I used 1/4 teaspoon). I actually went to lie down about 9:00 P.M. I got up about midnight, my throat felt a little better but I decided to gargle again. By the time I woke up this morning, about 9:00 A.M., my sore throat was gone! This really does work.

However, the sore throat started the day before our anniversary and I didn't want to miss our big day. And the throat was getting more sore as the hours went by. Thought what the heck do I have to lose .... I am very happy to say that it would beautifully. I gargled on and off for several hours before I went to bed. Got up the next morning and the sore throat was gone!!

6693	111	7579	Garrick from Corning, CA	2007-01-01 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I'm a 17 year old from California, and my entire family has been coming down with some pretty nasty sickness. My grandfather owns a family run business, so when one uncle got it, so did my grandfather, my dad, and everyone else that works there. They all got sore throats the first few days which led to just generic sickness. Stomach feels bad, coughing, dizziness. I had so far been free of the plague until yesterday night when my throat began feeling sore. I knew what was coming but ignored it until the morning. This morning I woke up with terrible pain in my throat, it felt swollen, and it hurt to swallow. I immediately jumped on google for sore throat cures and your remedy came up. It worked perfectly after 4 gargles over about an hour. I just took a small cup and lined the bottom with cayenne and filled the rest with warm water, gargling as long as I could then swallowing a little bit afterwards. After the first time I felt significantly better, and my throat was only a little raw, but after the 2nd time it went away completely! I did it a couple more times for good measure and I'm now doing it periodically just to be sure it doesn't come back. What a great cure!!! Although I still feel semi-sick I no longer have a sore throat which was the worst of it. I'll recommend this cure, and this site, to everyone.

I've gargled three times this morning and already there is a marked improvement in my throat and I'm not coughing as much. I must give a WARNING though...I didn't know the quantities to start with so used a teaspoon full in one mug of water and it damn nearly blew my head off!!! A quarter of a teaspoon is quite enough! Good stuff though.
6696	111	7582	Lila from London	2006-12-27 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Hi, i must say that i am astounded at the effectiveness of this concoction.i have been suffering from a very very sore throat since yesterday, i was awake all last night because of the pain .this morning i was so fed up of taking painkillers that i went to the gp very very early 9.30 hoping to see a doctor and a magical cure. AS usual i was greeted by a very scary looking receptionist with a big patronizing smile who said "no more appointments left for today unfortunately you'll have to come back tomorrow"in a tone of voice you would have to be crazy to challenge.so i just shook my head in agreement vigorously and made hasty return to my flat back to my misery.Then all of a sudden i thought why not google it? And i came upon this cure. GUESS WHAT? it really really works .i was afraid to try it at first obviously i mean a chili dissolved in water gargle on a sore throat? That sounded so crazy that i was throwing insults at the computer for being insensitive and stupid. Then after searching and suffering and only finding the only other usual alternatives like water and salt or lemon and water i decided to give it a try .i mean at that point i had nothing to lose i was already on my death bed. so i got a glass of warm water and mixed a teaspoon of chili in it and gargled with that every 15 mins until it finished .that was around 12oclock today its now about four in the afternoon i have just had a nice meal-trust me that's a big accomplishment after nearly two days of not being able to swallow anything. I've looked in the mirror as well at my throat, it was looking very very red this morning with thick white coatings of pus. now its nearly returned back to its pinkish purplish hue and the white stuff is less as well so this gargle gets an absolute 10/10 from me

6699	111	7585	Samford from Louisville, KY	2006-12-26 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I just tried this remedy after waking up with a major sore throat. I'm still shocked that it worked. I love hot food but all I wanted was relief, and that's what I got. I had tried hot tea, honey, lemon, vitamins a&c, and homemade chicken noodle soup, but nothing even slightly alleviated the soreness like the cayenne. Five minutes until the next gargle. Thank you to the guinea pigs who dared to try this first.

I tried it and so far, it seems to have worked just great!! THANK YOU!
6701	111	7587	Iris from Escondido, CA	2006-12-22 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	yesterday afternoon i started to feel a little scratchy-ness in my throat, and i just blew it off thinking maybe it was from yelling or eating spicy food. This morning i woke up and my throat was throbbing and it felt swolen. Tomorrow i start my new job early in the morning and i knew i wouldn't be able to stand it with a sore throat so i looked online and found this site. i tried the cayenne pepper in water first thing and it worked magic. i gargled a few times and i swallowed a little bit and its not even that spicy just a little burn of the tongue, but it is soooooo worth it getting rid of a sore throat that fast!
6702	111	7588	Russell from Dallas, TX	2006-12-14 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	The Cayenne red pepper really does cure the sore throat. I gargled with it and accidentally swallowed some and my sore throat was literally gone instantly.
6703	111	7589	John from Louisville, KY	2006-12-14 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I was suffering from a sore throat which i thought was from a cold. Needed something because it was keeping me up at night. I found this site, tried it with some thick (which sucked) red peppers from the kitchen. WOW!!! is all i can say, yeah it was hot, but boy did it work.. First i thought, boo, its just because of the hot peppers distracting me from the pain. NOPE 4 hours later, still no pain. It did come back about half way through my work day, but i had picked some cayenne peppers up on the way. Another dose, another 3-5 hours pain free.. Amazing TRUELY AMAZING!! I went in and told my boss, "you know the reason i don't go to the doctor, cuz doctors don't give you real info" LOL!! Great fix, love this site
6704	111	7590	David from Palo Alto, CA	2006-12-11 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	This cayenne pepper remedy is a MIRACLE worker. I woke up on Saturday with the worst sore throat I have had in years. Sore throats are the part of a cold I hate MOST. Well anyway, this coming week starting tomorrow is finals week. I thought that I would have to skip the finals or worse, take them sick. I jumped online right when I woke up and found this remedy. On Saturday I gargled cayenne pepper in water every 15 minutes for 3 hours in the morning and and at night. To my surprise I woke up the next day with a mere scratchy throat. That day I gargled cayenne pepper only twice (at night). And the best part is that it cured most of my sinus problems that came with a cold. I woke up today with no sore throat whatsoever. I can now study all day without interruptions and without a cold in peace. Thanks Earthclinic!

6706	111	7592	Monica from Chicago, IL	2006-11-30 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I was having a sore throat, on and off, and this morning it was so severe that as i was checking my e mails, i decided to figure out a way to cure it by searching online. I stumbled across this site and i read about the cayenne pepper in warm water. I went and gargled the water and I was shocked to see how true and how fast it worked. And my throat was really hurting. It was like right after that, I felt so much better. Although my voice is still a bit horse, i will keep up with the cayenne pepper and warm water. Hopefully I will be cured as if nothing happened. I also saw the ACV column and I do have an on and off weight problem. I gain weight very easily so i was looking for a simple, non harsh way to fix it as I'm not a bad eater and I am kinda active. I have started the drink as of today and will keep you updated as soon as i see a result. After the cayenne pepper working, I am confident something good will come of the ACV also. I'm so glad i found this site. Thank you and thanks to the readers who help out with their experiences and comments.
6707	111	7593	D from Atlanta, GA	2006-11-29 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I've had a sore throat for the past couple of weeks. Unfortunately I had run out of cayenne pepper and forgot to get it every time I went to the store. I finally got some yesterday and gargled with a very STRONG concoction of cayenne and water. My sore throat disappeared after a few hours. Be careful how many shakes of pepper you do. I did about 5 shakes and my mouth burned like crazy for about 15 minutes... Had to suck on an ice cube!
6708	111	7594	Larry from Houston, Texas	2006-11-18 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have tried everything when I have sore throat due to allergies and/or sinus, cold. The cayenne pepper and warm water gargle work amazingly! The only side affect was my lips burned a little for two minutes afterward, but I rubbed ice on them. This is a miracle cure!
6709	111	7595	Karrie from Kent, WA	2006-11-17 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Amazing. I was very skeptical. I tried the iodine "cure" first because it was painless and I was afraid of drinking the cayenne (yes, I am a wimp). After two days of a very sore throat and an important week of meetings coming up, I was desperate to try it and so I bit the bullet and tried the gargle. It wasn't near as hot as I expected and to my amazement within a few hours I had a ton of relief. I woke up the next day totally cured and it has been 4 days and it didn't return. Completely healed. I will spread the word of this cure and this website. THANK YOU!!
6710	111	7596	Mikey from Sault Ste. Marie	2006-11-15 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	So when I first came on this website I was pretty skeptical of whether or not I was going to gargle hot pepper in my mouth. Then I saw a girl Lisa from my home town Sault Ste. Marie posted some feedback. I thought that this must be a real remedy because of the obscure hometown reference. I don't like hot food too too much, and it sounded gross. It's actually not that bad, nowhere near as gross as buckleys and many medicines you get at the pharmacy. It does make your throat tingle from the hotness, but it's not that bad. The best part, I haven't coughed since I took the first gargle ! I strained a tiny muscle in my ribs from all the coughing, and so every time i'd cough it would really sting in that area, I couldn't take it anymore. That is why I went online to do research. I have already been taking Advil, Vicks cadies, Vitamin C, Honey, Cough syrup, using Vaporub and drinking tea. None of it worked, or if it did, it was very temporary. Thank you so much for the important information.
6711	111	7597	Maeve from Belfast, Northern Ireland	2006-11-14 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	The hot tomato drink and cayenne pepper gargle cure my sore throat and cold symptoms. Great site. Thank you for the above remedies. My colds usually last about a week and generally develop into sinus problems but this time they didn't. Will pass your site on to other sufferers.
6712	111	7598	Daniela from New York, NY	2006-11-01 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Cayenne pepper gave me some relief, it looked like it was working as anesthetic, but the real healing of a very bad sore throat happened when I put together cayenne extract and a tea spoon of Osha root extract. A Nepalese man at the Health Food Store went directly to this herb and told me this is the strongest cure in Chinese medicine for the throat. It really worked, I added also some garlic. I both swallowed and gargled with it. Thank you a lot for your site!
6725	111	7611	Cassie from Springfield, OH	2006-07-30 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	wow!... i didn't think this stuff would really work!... i just got back from cheer camp and i had no voice at all and i needed an overnight cure because we were holding a cheer camp of our own the next day... so i was looking for cures online and i saw this and i thought i would try it... within seconds of gargling this stuff i had a voice again... this stuff is a miracle worker!!... i am absolutely amazed!
6713	111	7599	Gerry from Seattle	2006-10-23 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Cayenne pepper cured a sore throat that had expanded and totally shut down all breathing including through the nose and mouth. I take 1/2 tsp of 90k heat units of cayenne daily in my protein drink along with several fruits and herbs etc. This past Friday night my throat became very sore and I could not swallow. The throat swelled and totally closed off. Breathing through the nostrils ceased as well. I put my fingers down my throat to give a convulsive reaction and try to get some air. My wife was going to call 911 and I waved her off. Finally after several tries to throw up I was able to get a little air. I had my wife drive to the store for some expectorants/lozenges etc. (the usual things we try)
6714	111	7600	Lisa from Sault Ste. Marie, Canada	2006-10-17 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	My sore throat has been getting worse over 3 days time. I was at my witts end 10 minutes ago. I came to this web site because I was desparate for some relief. I tried GSE, tea, echinacea, lozenges, medication and just about everything I could get my hands on without seeing a doctor. I just finished gargling with the cayenne-water solution and my sore throat is GONE!!! It does burn a wee bit but the results are absolutely AMAZING!! I just know i will have to keep gargling the solution but it sure does beat a 6 hour wait time at the emergency department eh? THANK YOU!
6715	111	7601	Debbie from England	2006-10-10 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	i tried the thyme in warm water first, but my throat was so bad it did not touch it... so went on your site and found the cayenne pepper one, which i always have in. At first it didn't feel any different then after about four minutes my throat felt much better. i will carry on until its gone . thank you earth clinic. also about your acid reflux survey, my husband has severe acid refux to the point that should he collapse (as he has done)he cannot be put in the recovery position as the acid comes up and chokes him . he took ibuprofen for four years for pain following a motorbike accident and docs think that it what caused the acid reflux.
6716	111	7602	Sherri from Millstone, KY	2006-10-10 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have this severe sore throat at this time of year - every year - due to seasonal allergies to the Goldenrod, etc. Last year I suffered more than a week with a bad sore throat and had to have antibiotics to get rid of it. I got a bad sore throat starting Friday night the 6th. It kept me feeling awful all weekend. By Monday night I was so tired of being ill that I looked for a home remedy on the internet and came across this site. I found a treatment that I had right in my spice cabinet. So, I mixed 1/2 tsp of red cayenne pepper in 6 oz of warm water and gargled several times (each time) on Monday night, once Tuesday morning and once Tuesday afternoon. My sore throat, which I had all weekend, was gone after only 3 treatments!!! I'm sitting here writing this pain free!! That's some mean stuff, but truly Amazing! Now I'm trying the ACV and water for sinus congestion and infection. Thanks sooo much for the info!
6717	111	7603	Jake from Palm Desert	2006-10-06 00:00:00	NAY	1	0	I wanted desperately for this cure to work but unfortunately it didn't. I tried gargling every 15 minutes and drinking it but my throat remained sore. I have tried for three days now. I did however discover how great it is in tea. I added it to my peppermint and honey tea (for those of you not familiar with cayenne pepper, there is a warning on the side stating that the longer it is cooked (and that is what is happening in the tea) the hotter it gets. So make sure just to use a sprinkle or two) With the number of people it has worked for I would give it a try though. Good luck.
6718	111	7604	Angie from Oxford, AL	2006-09-28 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Thank you so much!! I've been sick for a week now. I went to the doctor and I spent $70.00 on meds. My Mom and Dad told me to try this. It sounded so crazy but I did and it WORKED almost immediately. I now believe in these home remedies and will do them for now on. Thanks!

6720	111	7606	Laura from Ithaca, NY	2006-09-25 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I'm a voice major in my second year of college and the weather in Ithaca constantly changes-- prime conditions for plenty of colds to start up, not to mention prime conditions to annoy my allergies. I was landed with a cold in my third week up here and immediately went to the campus health center. I was prescribed a cough/congestion medicine that helped me get better, but very slowly. To make matters worse, I had to run auditions one night for the student-run musical. I sucked it up and sang through my terrible sore throat for the whole two hours. BIG. MISTAKE. The next day, my voice was completely shot. For a week afterwards, I couldn't even speak, much less sing. My sore throat went away, but I still had terrible laryngitis. Finally, after missing a second voice lesson--which puts me in danger of losing my major--I decided something had to be done. I had heard of the cayenne pepper remedy awhile ago, but I never had any on hand. This time, I called a friend and asked her to pick up some cayenne pepper at the local store for me. That night, I drank two glasses of water with cayenne pepper mixed in. I despise spicy foods, so it took a lot of guts for me to drink it, but drink it I did, and lo and behold my voice suddenly sounded tons better the next day. Not only that, but my congestion had cleared up a great deal. Cayenne pepper is the stuff of the gods and I am so glad I found this site. THANK YOU, EARTH CLINIC!
6721	111	7607	Paula from Lancaster, OH	2006-09-14 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have had this virus for about a month and a half now. I felt like I had gotten better about 2 weeks ago and then it came back with a vengence. Low grade fever every day, plugged ears, severe cough, postnasal drip, sore throat, swollen spleen, swollen glands, fatigue. My daughter has same symptoms and was diagnosed via blood test with mono. I am pretty sure thats what I have too. I am desperate for an antivral cure. Have tried crushed garlic 3 x day w/ no effect. I inhale saline every 2 hours thru nose. Antibiotics were tried in the beginning before the mono diagnosis with no result. Tried Cayenne pepper gargle which relieves the sore throat but I am looking for a more permanent solution. I was told that olive leaf extract will kick the virus but I cannot find any info on it. Does anyone have any they could pass on?
6722	111	7608	Rob from Boston	2006-09-13 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Nice, this worked for me almost immediately. It stings a little but its definitely worth it!
6723	111	7609	Debby from Paris, TN	2006-08-20 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I am always willing to try something with out pills to heal myself. I couldn't wait to get out of work as I was so miserable I wanted to crawl under the table and die lol but I bought some cayenne powder and started gargling with it at midnight.... it was hotter than coal to me but I could feel it kicking in, it not only took away the sore throat but decongested my head and my chest! Unbelievable! I would have spent a fortune at the doctor on stupid meds and antibiotics that don't do anything but relieve symptoms! I will pass that around to anyone that tells me they have a sore throat and then some! And your site! Thank you for having it!!! Now I can go to work and put myself into my job! :) Ty TY TY TY TY
6726	111	7612	Armando from Boynton Beach, FL	2006-07-30 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have been trying OTC medicines for a couple of days seeking relief from a sore throat. You know it feels like you swallow every ten seconds when you have a sore thoat, you don't realize this relfex is repeated so often automatically UNTIL you have a sore throat! At any rate, I googled home remedies and found this powerful, effective method to relieve sore throat, I did it last night and felt relief right away, this morning it was a little bit painful again but I repeated the cayenne pepper gargles and felt relief right away, it works!
6727	111	7613	Jennifer from Newton, Iowa	2006-07-21 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I wasn't sure whether or not this would work. I got a sore throat today and it has gotten worse through the day. I have tried four different store medications and Lozenges nothing has made my throat feel any better at all. I got on the internet and looked for ways to cure sore throats and found the cayenne pepper remedy, So I went to the store and got some cayenne pepper and within a few minutes my throat felt better. at least I can swallow and talk now!
6728	111	7614	D from Abq, NM	2006-07-19 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Made a cayenne pepper "tea" using 1/2t in 1 cup of very warm water and sipped slowly. The pain is gone for now, will repeat later with maybe 1/4t. Gargling was harder than just taking small sips. My first gargle really made me cough. The heat makes the fumes more potent.
6729	111	7615	James from St. Pete, FL	2006-07-12 00:00:00	NAY	1	0	I don't know what people are talking about. I tried the Cayenne peper and hot water on my sore throat and it only made things worse. Now not only does my throat still hurt but my mouth is full of spit that hurts to swallow. Then to make things even worse the cayenne pepper loosed a lot mucus so now it hurt coming up and down. Whatever you do don't swallow this stuff it burned the hell out my throat. Only plus I can say is I do feel wide awake, but its after midnight now I have to get up 6 hours.
6730	111	7616	Carole from Alexandria, Ontario	2006-07-08 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	My throat was on fire! I couldn't swallow my spit it was horrible. Now I come here and read that I had to gargle with cayenne pepper? Well I was at the end of my rope, either try this or go to the hospital for it has been 4 days of pure hell. I first gargled this mixture WOW my mouth was on fire! After a few minutes I figured well at least something else hurt instead of my thoat so I tried it again after 15 minutes and again after that. It's amazing, I can actually feel my throat getting better! It doesn't hurt as much as before and I'm beginning to swallow without making a horrible face lol. Please, if you have a very bad sore throat, try it. Believe me it's worth it.
6731	111	7617	Kodi from Perthy, WA	2006-07-07 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I am so amazed this worked. It was hot as hell, but within half an hour my glands had halved in size and it wasn't nearly as difficult to swallow. Will continue the gargle (2 tsp in glass of warm water) until symptoms disappear!! Yay.
6732	111	7618	Joe from Aransas Pass, Texas	2006-07-02 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	This remedy most definitely takes away the pain of a sore throat and also eases the swelling of glands in the throat. I simply boiled 2 cups of water and made a tea with about three tablespoons of pepper. I then gargled this tea for about 5 minutes and felt some great relief! I repeated this gargle in 15 minutes and noticed that my glands aren't nearly as swollen now. This is a wonderful remedy! You must try it!
6733	111	7619	John A from San Jose	2006-07-01 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	FRIGGIN A!!! this stuff actually works. Man i never EVER try anything i hear from the internet but this ISH works! I was out playing bball with the homies at the bball cage, we play till the nights get cold and even rainny nights. i guess i caught a fever and sore throat from that. it's been hurting now for 4 days. this instantly killed the pain. my swollen neck is dwindling in size and MAN! it feels good to be back in action. thanks penny and all the folks testimonies that helped me do this.
6734	111	7620	Shana from El Paso, TX	2006-06-19 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	This really worked or I would not have commented on it. I never comment about anything good or bad. This worked within seconds. When I was making this concoction I thought this is silly but as soon as the cayenne pepper and water mixture hit my throat I could tell it was already working. I turn into a little baby when I have a sore throat. Those days are over. Thank you for your help.
6735	111	7621	Mit from Van Nuys, CA	2006-06-18 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I woke up this morning and my neck and cheeks were completely swollen. My throat felt like a knife was piercing through it. I gargled in salt water 3 times... and then i found this site. I tried the cayenne pepper in cold and hot water and gargled a whole bottle. I was in so much pain I was desperate for the swelling to go down. AND IT worked.... at 9:30pm, a few hours later... I was able to eat, talk and swallow again. Thanks so much... it's a sunday and I couldn't get to a doctor!!
6736	111	7622	Jonny from Los Angeles	2006-06-15 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I too was in extreme pain from a viral sore throat infection and nothing else was seeming to do the trick to alleviate. I have heard of the cayenne thing before, but never tried it. Yesterday I decided to, and was (like everyone else) completely shocked at how well it worked. The only complaint I have is that last night and today, no matter how much cayenne I use, it doesn't seem to work quite as well. Whatever, at least it soothes the pain and lets me swallow. Thanks.
6737	111	7623	Lauren from DeSoto, MO	2006-06-08 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Holy sh--! This stuff really works! I have had a terrible cold the past few days and nothing seemed to help. My throat got to hurting so bad I thought "what the hell?" I will try this cayenne pepper stuff. It is at home and I like not having to go out and buy medicine. I did it about three times one night and the next morning it was almost completely gone! The only part that was still sore was a tiny corner in the back of my throat, and later in the morning, even that went away. Thanks a lot!
6738	111	7624	Fionna from St. Andrews, Scotland	2006-06-05 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I had a bad attack of sinusitis. In one day my throat was sore. I coughed up all sorts of nasties that night. Started herbs the next day, and that night it dropped in my chest. Unlike anything I have ever had. Anyway, after two weeks I saw the end of the tunnel, and BOOM! My throat started feeling sore... two days later I woke up with pain. I grabbed the flashlight, mirror, and took a wee look... hmmm... oh yes, red splosh with white heads... STREP. Will the torment ever end I said to myself. Again, I digress. I Googled strep, found this site. I tried the Apple Cider...no success. I tried the cayenne. Burn baby burn. I noticed a wee bit of ease in about 40 minutes. I have done the cayenne about six times today and compared to the pain this morning, I dare say, my throat feels 40% better! :-) My tongue has wee bit more colour. Almost all the wee white heads are gone, and the red splosh...not as red! Again... :-) I will be more diligent tommorrow with the cayenne. I put about two cups of water in a pot. I then added about 4 cayenne capsules (40,000 Heat units each) to the water. I then simply heated it up on the stove everytime I gargled. Easy-Peasy. The burn is worth it. Give it a go then! I thank the Lord Almighty for this site and cayenne pepper. God bless and all get well soon!

Could not breath especially when laying down, throat hurt so bad last night in particular I was wishing I'd gone to the Doctor (but kept thinking eh, it'll go away!!) I went on line and found this site and out of desperation (throat lozenges, sprays, ibuprofen, cold medicine... not of that was helping with the pain) I looked in my pantry for cayenne, couldn't find any, found hot pepper sauce and cayenne is in it, mixed about 2 teasp. in really hot water maybe 1/4 cup or less and gargeled the heck out of it, I did it three times and finally fell asleep about 3a.m., I woke up and I could swallow again without tears and I was coughing up all kind of foul stuff. I am amazed.
6743	111	7629	Heidi from Cheshire, UK	2006-04-12 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Have had a really sore throat all week, its something i suffer with a lot along with it always goes a horrid chesty cough, Could not sleep at all last night as chest was full of mucus and throat was so sore for constant coughing all night. Finally my poor partner gave up and went to sleep in the spare room, was so fed up and had tried all the throat tablets going so decided to google sore throat remedies, was AMAZED to see cayenne pepper as a cure, after pluckingup the courage to give it a go i mixed 2 tps in half a jug of warm water........ tasted foul, burnt my tongue and lips but after several attempts to return to the kitchen to give it another try, my throat does actually feel a little better, could be the tingling lips and numbness but hoping it's a sign that my throat is healing!

I had a sore throat for 3 days and I tried everything, but this actually worked and allowed me to finally get a good night's sleep. THANK YOU!!
6745	111	7631	Tom from Cleveland, OH	2006-03-24 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU! I have had a cold for 3 days now. Yesterday morning I developed a sore throat. The soreness didn't really bother me until later on in the day. I bought some throat lozenges. They didn't work at all as far as helping the soreness. I think they made it worse. My throat got so sore that I didn't even want to swallow. I "yahooed" natural cures and found this site. I tried the cayenne pepper after reading reviews from other people. I gave it a try. I had some cayenne pepper powder in my kitchen pantry. I popped the shaker top off and poured some into some warm water. I gargled with it for about 10 minutes. I even dipped a cotton swab in the solution and swabbed my tonsils, palette and the little "punching bag" in the back of my throat with the solution. I WAS AMAZED!!! I COULD NOT BELIEVE HOW BETTER MY THROAT FELT!!! I'm going back to the kitchen in about 15 minutes to gargle again with this solution. I honestly believe there is no need for toxic medications prescribed by doctors. I believe that the cures for most diseases come from the earth. In my opinion man made drugs are nothing but poison. The side effects of these drugs cause more harm than good. I rather eat raw garlic than take an antibiotic. I rather take hawthorn berries for high blood pressure than take a pill. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS SITE! TG--CLEVELAND
6746	111	7632	Sheri from Savannah, GA	2006-03-24 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Hello, I am a registered nurse in Georgia, and I woke up 5 days ago with a sore throat. I blamed it on the ever present seasonal allergies, since all things outside is yellow with pine pollen. Unfortunately, the 103 degree fever led my nursing instinct to get out the flashlight and take a look inside. Yep, there was those white patches and red spots. I visited my primary care Dr, got the recommended antibiotic, and my throat is still as sore and red as it was when I started taking the medication, and my fever has not went down any. I stumbled on this site this evening hoping to help myself since "medication" is failing me, and low and behold if the cayenne pepper gargle worked perfect as described. I did not have any in the house other than a popular brand brown bag chili mix, so I ripped open the bag and stole the pepper out. I mixed up the rinse and it worked immediately. I felt my nose open at once. I am pleasantly impressed. I have felt horrible for 5 days, and have laid in the bed all day today, but now I feel good enough to send this e-mail so others will maybe find these success stories. Thank You so much.

6748	111	7634	Marilyn from Hanford, CA	2006-03-07 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have had a nagging cough after I got rid of the strep throat with ACV. But I kept coughing (some times I would have to vomit from coughing so much) and I couldn't get any sleep. I got on line today and read Penny's remedy and tried it and it burned I guess my throat was raw from the coughing. IT WORKED IMMEDIATELY NOT EVEN TWO MINUTES I MEAN RIGHT AWAY THE COUGHING STOPPED. Every now and then I have had a cough but nothing like before. My ribs are so sore from all the coughing. Thank you guys for all the sharing of these natural remedies. God Bless
6750	111	7636	Aaron from New Port Richey, FL.	2006-02-11 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Well, where to begin. I got up Sunday with a tickle in my throat. I was suppose to sing at church and by the time I arrive could not. By half time of Superbowl the sore throat an congestion had set in. Worked Mon, Tues and Wed thinking I could get through it, but after not sleeping Tues and Wed, I was simply put exhausted and tired of being sick. Called in sick Thurs, figuring I really needed to rest to beat this, since I had not been this sick in 5 years. Missed work again Fri. By Fri evening I decided to look online for natural remedies. My symptoms, sore (strep throat), hard packed congestion, coughing up the vilest green/yellow crap I have ever seen. Having diagnosed myself with strep throat, I search Dogpile with ("strep throat" "natural cures"). This is how I found the Earthclinic website, of which I consider myself blessed to have found. Under the "sore throat" section I read the "Penny's cayenne pepper remedy". I thought to myself, you have got to be kidding me. However, I was so miserable I figured what do I have to loose. So I sprinkled some cayenne in a glass, mixed in some warm water and gargled about 5 times (swallowing only a very small amount each time). By the time I was done I could tell there was something good happening. I waited 15 minutes and repeated the same procedure. When I finished I just couldn't believe it. My swollen sore glands were all but gone and the thick green/yellow was breaking up. I said "praise God", took a Melatonin (for sleeping) and crashed. I woke up about 3 hours later, hauked a few loogies (no where near as bad as before), gargled again and went back to sleep. When I got up in the morning I simply could not believe how good my throat felt, so I gargled again thinking if what I did makes me feel this good, doing it again will make me feel even better. However, my sinuses were still pretty packed and discharge still fairly green/yellow. By now Doris, my wife had arose around 6:00 a.m. (she had the same thing prior to my getting it and still had not fully recovered now almost 2 weeks after it started). I told her the above, she then asked where did I get the info and what do they say about sinus infections. We both looked at the site this morning and saw the info about Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV). We looked at each other in amazement, looked at the ACV on the top of the stove and made a couple of ACV cocktails for breakfast. Within an hour I had no more green/yellow snott. It is now 10:30 a.m. and my nose still runs abit but clear discharge verses the vile stuff previously mentioned. I simply cannot put into words how much better my throat feels. 12 hours earlier I told my wife the best thing I could use for my throat would be a knife. :-) I am still coughing a little but nothing like the 4 days prior that make your head ache and pound. Even sitting here finishing this script, I keep saying outloud to myself, "I can't believe how good my throat feels! I can't believe how good my throat feels! ..." I am a skeptic who has been turned into an advocate. The only thing you have to lose is sleepless nights and a smaller pay check. Are you with me??

I TRIED THE REMEDY OF CAYENNE WITH WATER, GARGLING IT EVERY 15 MINUTES. HOWEVER IT WAS TOO HOT FOR ME TO CONTINUE PAST THE FIRST TRY. THEN I DECIDED TO TRY THE REMEDY OF WATER WITH ACV... AND IT WORKED WONDERS, MY SORE THROAT VANISHED WITHIN A FEW DAYS. I THEN RECOMMENDED IT TO MY FAMILY WHEN THEY CAME DOWN WITH A BAD SORE THROAT THAT HAD LASTED FOR MORE THEN A WEEK. THEY TRIED IT ALSO AND TO THEIR AMAZEMENT, IT WORKED IN A FEW DAYS. THANKS SO MUCH FOR THIS REMEDY. I ALSO HAVE HEARD ACV IS GOOD FOR WEIGHT LOSS, I INTEND TO TRY THIS IN THE FUTURE FOR THIS REASON.
6752	112	7638	Laurie from Corona, CA	2006-12-31 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I got sick Christmas Day and Could not talk. My throat was on fire it felt like it was closing up and I couldn't hardly swallow. I used the cayenne pepper remedy and it was still real bad. I got thirsty after all that hot pepper gargling so I drank some ice cold water which I thought was going to make it worse. Almost immediately my sore throat went away and it never returned. My son 15 yrs old got sick with a sore throat the next day and couldn't hardly swallow. I told him to try the cold water and his throat stopped hurting also, but it started hurting again hours later so we're going to repeat the water and gargle with cayenne pepper and APV remedy. This is much cheaper that all the medication I use to buy every time one of my 4 kids gets sick. I love this site, I hope you stay around forever! Laurie

6754	112	7640	Tina from Helena, AL	2006-12-15 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Hi There. I ran across this website the other night as I was searching the internet in search of a natural approach to cure a sore throat that was so advanced that my tonsils were red and looked blistery and I could hardly swallow. It was very painful. I ran across the recommendation for the Cayenne pepper gargle but then saw that if I added ACV to this that I could drink it and it would cure my sinuses also which I have had a problem with for years and had a discharge of mucous every morning that was almost a reddish-brown color and tons of pressure in my head and had been taken Advil cold and sinus for it. I began drinking it yesterday morning and still did the Cayenne pepper and water gargle last night. My throat is already cleared up and I believe my sinuses are beginning but I am not sure what is happening with my sinuses. It seems to me like I am coughing up alot of stuff that has probably been there for while and I noticed that my mucous is now a light yellow color. My nose is also stuffy and I feel like I am literally coughing up stuff out of my chest that I didn't even know was there (lol). I am still drinking this little mixture today and will continue to as I believe that what is happening is that I am healing and that all of this that has been there is beginning to come out and I can tell because although my mucous is not clear yet and is very light yellowish, it is not brown/reddish which says something (lol). Despite all of this (The stuffy nose and coughing up mucous) I seem to feel great with a very high energy level and no pressure in the head causing it to ache. So I will let you know the final result and am very grateful for this remedy and this wonderful website and will be consulting it regularly for my health concerns and my clients.
6755	112	7641	Natalie from Carmel, IN	2006-08-14 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have a cold that started two days ago and was beginning to really suffer from sore throat and loss of voice. I made a tea of acv and cayenne pepper (non-organic grocery store kind) and sipped two mugs w/in 20 minutes last evening. By the time I went to bed, my throat no longer hurt and this morning I am able to speak more clearly. I know from experience that my colds last quite a long time and this wonderful tea has reduced my sick time. In fact, I didn't get to the "feel worse before you feel better" part! I will continue sipping throughout the day for good measure. Thanks for the great, healthy help!
6756	112	7642	Ani from Ontario, Canada	2006-07-06 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Well i'd been struggling with some form of tonsillitis for over a month. Viral (not strep since two swab tests came back negative, though only AFTER i had already taken an entire bottle of Penicillin!). It became so bad this week that i could hardly swallow. I'd never seen my tonsils so swollen, they were covered in white stuff and the doctor pointed out they were secreting puss - eeeuu! Well I made a tea using hot water, a couple spoons of apple cider vinegar and about 1/3 - 1/2 tspn of cayenne pepper. All symptoms are COMPLETELY gone after only 2 days of drinking this once or twice a day. REMARKABLE! I will drink this in a more diluted form on a daily basis as it gave me energy and makes me feel great in general
6757	112	7643	Ed from Ocoee, fl	2006-06-15 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	First time I have ever been to the Earth Clinic site, and as I had a terrible sore throat and the beginnings of the Flu, I thought I'd try anything. I tried gargling with ACV and Cayenne it took care of it immediately, could not believe anything would work that fast. The next day I woke up with the Flu. I tried the ACV drink and without taking anything else, the Flu was gone in two days. Truly amazing! I have told everyone about the site and my cure. Most impressive - Thanks
6758	112	7644	Diane from PA	2006-05-08 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I developed swollen lymph nodes inside my throat - right one was so swollen I could feel it through the outside of my neck and this all developed in 2 days. My doctor is on vacation and I remember hearing something about vinegar so I looked it up and wound up mixing straight apple cider vinegar (store brand) and McCormick Cayenne Pepper powder in a glass and gargled 3 times. The pain was significantly reduced for me and now I am having a hot cup of Irish Breakfast Tea with honey and lemon juice. I plan to keep going with the cayenne and vinegar.
6759	112	7645	Steve	2006-05-04 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	This hit me last Sunday, as I was exhausted, for no reason. Then I woke up Mon. with a slight sore throat, that got worse later in the day. Tues. it hit me like a freight train. I had a horrible sore throat that went all through my neck up to my ear. There wasn't a spot on me that didn't hurt to the touch. Every joint ached. My teeth even hurt. I started taking my wife's ACV on Tues.. Yesterday I put in a little red pepper. Last night I woke up in a cold, thick sweat. Today I feel 100% better with only a mild sore throat and no aches. I am still very weak though, I don't what this was, but I'm sure it was some type of flu. The guys at work gave me this and they went to the Dr. so I'll ask them. Thanks for the tips!!!
6760	112	7646	Kristin from Dallas, TX	2006-04-02 00:00:00	NAY	1	0	Sorry guys I tried the ACV and the Cayenne Pepper mixed together and diluted down with some water and had no success as of yet. Then, out of desperation, I did a straight shot of the AVC and rinsed with water, still no results. I'll keep trying and see how the day goes!
6761	112	7647	Lynn from Waterville, Maine	2007-08-15 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I learned about raspberry tea and started using a cup of warm raspberry tea with 1/2tsp of apple cider vinegar to gargle with and spit back out. I freaked when I saw the gunk it was nasty. If caught in time it gives a nice relief of a sore throat. From time to time I just gargle to keep from getting a build up of gunk. Especially during allergy seasons. I hope this helps as it did for me.
6762	112	7648	Paul from Melbourne, Australia	2009-07-11 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Yes the cayenne pepper works wonders. so does baking soda because of its alkalinity. (bacteria love an acidic environment) But I highly recommend putting a roll of toilet paper in the freezer for when you need it, and boy will you need it. I felt like i was giving birth to a marine distress flare on the toilet. Also something that is of "enormous" help. WARMTH. keep the neck area warm as possible with a large towel. and sleep with it on all night. you'll be amazed at what a difference it makes. White blood cells in your saliva love love loves warmth, and they are more active in a warm environment. SO WHAT WORKS FOR ME. First gargle apple cider to quickly remove the flem to expose the bacteria or virus, then hit it with baking soda. the baking soda makes the infected area alkaline. then hit it with the cayenne pepper. then wrap up the neck area with a towel and sleep with it on. If that doesn't work, I'll be dammed !
6763	112	7649	Jane from Grove City, OH, USA	2008-10-14 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Listerine. It cures your throat sores immediately, doesn't taste gross, and it makes your breath smell better. Use the amount you usually do for mouthwash rinsing, or if you haven't used it before use about one tablespoon. Gargle it as far back as you can without swallowing it. It really takes away the burn!
6764	112	7650	Betty from Broken Arrow, Ok	2012-11-23 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Had bad sore throat for several days and got low grade fever last night. Tried gargling with listerine, hydrogen peroxide... Neither worked. Have always loved EC site so decided to see what others used. Last night I made a mixture of 3T of ACV, 1T honey, and 1/4 cup water. Didn't have cayenne on hand. I gargled 3-4 times with mixture and then sipped the little that was left. It took a couple of hours, but the sore throat and fever left me. I slept well and am feeling good this morning. PTL!
6765	112	7651	My2cents from Rock Hill, Sc, USA	2012-11-18 00:00:00	NAY	1	0	Talk about regrets! I am an ACV fanatic. I believe whole heartedly in the power of ACV. Especially the unfiltered, unpasteurized ACV with "the mother". BUT in this case, I regret it. I started out with a very sore throat. I was unable to swallow food, and swallowing even liquids was uncomfortable, but not unbearable. I mixed the vinegar and honey. Gargled, swallowed. I noticed that WHILE I was gargling I felt great. My throat did not hurt at all. And for maybe ten seconds afterward. THEN, I noticed that gradually, my throat got worse and worse. It now hurts so bad to swallow that I try just spitting unless I am drinking something. I say proceed with caution.

Didn't have the honey as recommended) and wow that did a job on my throat. It feels 80% better after one treatment. Thanks for the post. I was about to try salt water gargling for the umpteenth time even though it never seemed to work before.

I drank some Apple Cider Vinegar mixed with raw honey and it helped one side of my throat feel better which is better than nothing. It was a quick effect. The drink also helped my sister with a sore throat as well; didn't cure it but probably might have if she had more than a cup.
6768	112	7654	Angle from Lawrenceville, Ga	2011-12-17 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I use 2 tbsp. Apple cider vinegar, 2 tbsp. Honey, lemon juice and a little hot water to dilute. It's still potent but more bearable. The first time I used it years ago, my throat was completely swollen and "closed" up like a strep infection. I used it 3-4 times a day and knocked it out. I only use a little water so that I'm done quicker :) then drink water after to wash it down.

6773	112	7659	Alicia  from Chapel Hill, Nc, Usa	2011-02-28 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Yea - read the suggestions last night after 3 days of a sore throat that wouldn't quit. Did the 3 TBS of ACV and 8 oz of hot water. I'm on a diet so only did 1 TBS of honey. I sipped and gargled it as slowly as I could although I did feel pretty lousy after (no sugar no carb diet probably didn't help w/ACV in my stomach). BUT, I woke up this AM feeling a little better and now 24 hours later my sore throat is almost completely gone. I'm going to try ACV for seasonal allergies, which are starting here, just will make sure to have something more on my stomach. Thanks Earth Clinic - now off to find cures for wrinkles and gray hair :-).
6774	112	7660	Victoria from New York City, Usa	2011-02-07 00:00:00	NAY	1	0	I tried this. First I did 2 tblsp of this in a glass of water and drank it. That didnt work. Then I mixed the ACV in a mug of tea. That didnt work. Finally I just took the ACV straight to the head. This didnt work either. So now I have a disgusting taste in my mouth and still a sore throat. :/

Also if you mix a teaspoon of ACV with a teaspoon of honey in a cup of tea, heat and drink, it will not only give you more energy but also help your sore throat feel much better.

6778	112	7664	Feeling Better Already from Northland, New Zealand	2009-11-13 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have to say that ACV diluted with warm water worked for me. The usual story, woke with an awful sore throat & couldn't swallow without feeling like I had sandpaper at the back of my throat. I remembered someone else mentioning ages ago that ACV helps. I hunted out a bottle that's probably been in the pantry since the beginning of time and I tried it. And you know what...? It works! First dose I knocked back 'straight'! (ugh..!) Wow - needed a warm water chaser then. Am now sipping it with diluted warm water & will continue throughout the day. Sore throat has not completely gone as yet, but definitely feeling so much better. I can actually swallow without cringing. It almost seems to have an anaesthetic effect too. I smell like a pickled onion, but more importantly, I can breathe & swallow & actually function almost normally. Great stuff I say! No more pharmacies & docs for me when I get a sore throat. Cheers!
6779	112	7665	Pmstar from San Diego, Ca	2009-08-06 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	When a sore throat is coming on take a few zinc tablets right away then I agree on the ACV mixed with honey. It works on contact. If you're at work or out, almost any full service restaurant can provide it for you so the sore throat doesn't take a solid hold before you get home. Apple Cider Vinegar can be difficult to stomach when you are ill so add some ginger to help your stomach accept it. When I'm well, I drink a shot of ACV straight each day and I eat blueberries to quickly remove the taste from my mouth. Its a morning ritual.
6780	112	7666	Joe C from Bear Creek , NC	2009-07-22 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I just tried a 3tsp acv, 3tsp honey with about 4 oz of water and it worked with the first sip. I decided on the 4 oz of water from some previous posts where people didn't experience immediate relief and it was suggested they not dillute as much. Any how, I sipped the stuff with a spoon and for the first time this week I have been able to swallow without tears. I have been taking amoxicillin for not quite two days, as I am lucky enough to have developed strep throat for the first time in over ten years during my summer vacation, but nothing I have tried would get rid of the burn in my throat. I wish I had found this site a few days ago and had a much better vacation!!
6781	112	7667	Donna from Palm Beach, Fl	2009-07-14 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Wow - my sore throat was slowly getting worse during the day despite lots of tea and water. It got so bad my ears were starting to burn and I could feel a distinct lump on my throat on the side where it hurt most. I was miserable and then found this site. I love ACV, using it as a salad dressing often - so I eagerly tried it and was amazed. I sipped about 4 ounces of the 9 ounces, slowly with a spoon and within a half hour I have had incredible relief. Not cured, but I can swallow without tears now. Will continue throughout the evening and hope it will go away before a big meeting tomorrow. thanks everyone for their posts!
6782	112	7668	Kelly from Perth, Australia	2009-07-06 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I used Apple Cider Vinegar straight and my sore throat faded immediately. When you swallow, tilt your head back and coat as much of your throat as possible. Although the taste is not nice, the results are really good, and really eased my throat as well as unblocked my nose. Leave it to sit for 30 minutes at least so it can do it's job, just bear the taste if you can.

I don't want to get the other band memebers sick during practice and was woken up in the middle of the night with a terrible sore throat. It was really burning! I tried the acv and honey with hot water and it already feels much better than it did. I'm going to keep drinking this and see if I can get myself better by tomorrow. This is a great home remody!

The pain has been terrible and taking advil or tylenol has been like drinking water. neither was any help at all. after coming here to see what home remedies were out there, i tried 3 tsp of acv 3 tsp honey, and 8oz very warm water and sipped it like tea. it did'nt cure me but i did get some relief on the first glass. I've drank 3 glasses since yesterday and although the pain is still there it's not as intense

I have a straight forward cold with swollen glands and a sore throat. I tried the 3 to 3 ACV and whatever honey was in my cupboard and it's been less than an hour and I have no pain! At first I was wary and gargled, and now an sipping my "tea"...it worked great for me, but I am only sipping as to not have stomach upset. The taste doesn't bother me at all! Thanks so much for all of the feedback which helped me to decide upon trying this particular home remedy. God Bless.
6786	112	7672	John from Houston, TX	2009-05-24 00:00:00	NAY	1	0	This was absolutely the worst thing I could have done. I'd taken ibuprophen for 2 days with only limited results so I came to this website. I used 3 tsp ACV, 3 tsp honey and 8 oz. hot water. While I was taking it it did provide limited relief. Gargled roughly half and drank the rest. 30 minutes later after sitting on the sofa and feeling it get worse I got up and checked my temp. My temp had gone from 99.9 immediately before the using the ACV to 102.8 thirty minutes after (so its not as if my mouth were still hot from the drink). This stuff is not only useless its dangerous in my opinion. Stay away from this and if you've got a sore throat, see a licensed physician.

I went onto this website looking for a remedy because mine was not working. I saw the remedy for 3 tsp ACV and 3 tsp honey and decided to give it a try in some hot water. It worked great. It really does soothe the burning right out of the back of the throat. What a great remedy....thanks....

I couldn't sleep at night (didn't know why)and my husband complained of my snoring at night. I was told I have sleep apnea so I went to see a ENT specialist. He told me I have Acid Reflux and also allergy in my nose and breath though my mouth which makes me snore and I don't go to deep sleep. My life was hell, always tired and sleepy and just couldn't function in my daily life. My Dr. gave a pill to take for acid reflux (don't remember the name) and a steroid spray for my nose. I took them for 2 wks and they helped me sleep but my soar throat continued. Then I found this site :)
6791	112	7677	Heather from Jones, Florida	2009-04-21 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I currently have a terrible sore throat that I need to get rid of rather quickly because I work with elderly people in a nursing home. I went online to see if I could find a quick fix and I saw a remedy for Apple Cider Vinegar and decided to try it. I put 3tsp ACV and 3tsp regular honey into a hot glass of water and mixed it so the honey wasn't all as the bottom. I gargled the entire glass, one mouthful at a time and literally, after the first few gargles, my throat felt much better! It's still a bit tender, but better than what it was, so I'll continue to gargle ever two hours for the next day. Hopefully by tomorrow it's completely gone!

I thought about this website and went to the local store and picked up some apple cidar vinegar. Surprisingly, it did not taste as bad as the smelled. I will definitely share this remedy with my family and friends. Thank you so much for the help. I am glad that we as people are sticking together during tough times. Everyone cannot afford to run to a doctor for every little ailment. Thanks again.

I mixed 3 tsp of ACV, 2 tsp raw honey, 1 tsp Manuka honey and 8 oz of warm water. I was dreading the taste of it but it actually tastes not bad. Minutes later and I am feeling a slight relief. I gargled some of it and am sipping on the rest.

6797	112	7683	Stefanie from Boston, MA	2009-02-25 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have had a sore throat for about two days now and it wasn't working for me. I googled home remedies for sore throats and came across this website. I began reading about the Apple Cider Vinegar and believed it would work but was hesitant. I have been feeding this to my dog for a while now since shes been having a bladder problem and was suggested the ACV, which gave immediate results. The horrible smell of the ACV threw me off but I knew I had to do it so I gargled it, then choked it down. It was diluted with warm water so it was bearable but I almost threw it up immediately. Although it was disgusting it definitely worked, and I can feel my sore throat getting better already!
6798	112	7684	Aeron from Middleburg, VA	2009-02-23 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I had not heard of this before, but after finding your website, I mixed 3 tsp organic ACV and 3 tsp raw organic honey in a mug of hot water and drank it. It's actually pretty tasty! My sore throat was IMMEDIATELY better. Now, day two, the sore throat is gone but I have some chest congestion/coughing.... I'm off to try some garlic. Thanks for this great site. I will refer back to it often.

6801	112	7687	Harry and Betty from Fullerton, California	2009-02-02 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Just experienced the grand daddy of all sore throats and decided to try the ACV/Honey recommendation and you've made a believer out of me. I blended 3 tablespoons of ACV with 3 tablespoons of honey to which I added 8 ounces of warm water. I started by gargling the entire glass and in approx. 2 hours started to feel minor improvement so repeated the process and sipped very small quantities the second time around. Again, in a couple of hours I experiened futher relief. I repeated the process a third time and experienced definite relief from what was agonizing pain. I continued the treatment for a total of five times and after 36 hours am completely pain free. This is a minor miracle when you consider I started with my ears on fire and barely able to swallow and only then with a lot of discomfort. Thanks much to all who shared their experiece with this treatment it was very beneficial. Harry S.
6802	112	7688	DeskExplorer from Bristol, CT	2009-01-31 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I had a sore throat for about two days and it was very painful to swallow or talk. I decided to "google" for some home remedies for sore throat, before making an appointment to visit my doctor for antibiotics. I came to this site and decided to try the Apple Cider Vinegar with honey suggestion. I checked my cupboard and all I had was Apple Cider Vinegar and spring water in the fridge. I gargle with two capfull of apple cider vinegar mixed w/ warm water in a tea cup. I use half to gargle and the other half I sipped on until finished. My throat was still very sore, but I didn't expect immediate results. Nonetheless, about an hour before going to bed I decided to gargle with two capful of straight apple cider vinegar w/ no water. WHOA! THAT WAS INTENSE!! There was no burning or anything, but the vinegar was very STRONG! I awoke the next morning (6 hours later) and I could tell an immediate reduction in pain. Realising this I gargle two more capful of apple cider vinegar straight hoping that this would ease the pain even more. About 7-8 hours later the pain was completely gone. AMAZING!! This stuff really works!! Try it!
6803	112	7689	Jennifer from Long Beach, CA	2009-01-30 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I gargled with about 1/4 cup pure apple cider vinegar and it immediately gave me relief from my sore throat. I swallowed a small amount right after and the sore throat was literally numbed. I love the taste of vinegar and am known to douse food with vinegar, and swallowing that last bit was even tough. I think it's best if you can tolerate the vinegar without diluting it.

LAST WINTER WHILE IN FLORIDA I OBTAINED A VERY BAD SORE THROAT AND FOUND THAT IF I MIXED 2 TLBS OF HONEY WITH 2 TLBS OF APPLE CIDER VINEGAR AND TOOK A SPOONFUL OF THIS ABOUT EVERY HOUR IT CURED MY SORE THROAT AND SINCE I SING IN A BAND I COULD CONTINUE TO SING THAT EVENING. THIS ACV KILLS OFF THE BACTERIA AND THE HONEY IS A NATURAL CURE AS WELL.
6805	112	7691	plrsingp from Charlotte, North Carolina	2009-01-23 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have also had luck with using ACV as a remedy. But instead I used it to cure a sore throat. I had once read that using apple cider vinegar can kill bacteria that cause sore throats almost instantly. So what you do is gargle with 2 teaspoons of ACV and as little water as you can stand. Gargle for 30 seconds and then swallow... (the ACV contains potassium which is also good). Do it once every hour for a whole day and soon you will start to feel much better.
6806	112	7692	Sarah from Mebane, North Carolina	2009-01-17 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	acv worked well for me. i gargled with a 2-1 ratio of acv and water. gargled once every hour. decreased the water as tolerated. worked very well. sore throat was gone within 3 days.

I took 3 tblsp of ACV and 1 tblsp of Manuka Honey and it did help sooth it and I was able to get a few more hours sleep, I might do it again now as it's still sore. It was a bit horrible to take but the benefits were worth it.
6808	112	7694	Joan from Honolulu, Hawaii	2008-12-30 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	i tried the mixture of 3 tablespoons honey and 3 tablespoons of acv in 8 oz. of hot water, and have to say it really made a difference. my throat felt significantly better. in the past, gargling with acv has also helped me out. i plan to follow-up with gargling the acv. you have to gargle a LOT of it for as long as you can in order to fight off the sore throat. Thanks for the tip on the honey/acv mixture since it was easier for me to handle than the gargling.
6809	112	7695	Marianne from Portage, Indiana   USA	2008-12-23 00:00:00	NAY	1	0	I took 2 tbs acv, 2tbs honey and 8 ounces of water to help relieve cold symptoms and a sore throat. My throat is burning more than ever, is there something else that I can do to alleviate this problem.
6810	112	7696	Jennifer from Nunya, OH	2008-12-17 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Wow, thank you for this great recommendation! I woke up tonight with the absolute worst sore throat of my life, so I went surfing for home remedies. Found this, tried it right away, and wow!! What a difference! I must drink it slow because the cider is a bit hard on my stomach, but it most definitely has reduced the pain significantly. Before, I couldn't even swallow without cringing. I'm only halfway through the cup now, so hopefully when I am done, the soreness will have completely dissipated- still a tad uncomfortable.
6811	112	7697	Ernestine from Millington, USA	2008-12-16 00:00:00	BETTER BUT NOT CURED	2	0	ACV (3 tablespoons) and honey (3 tablespoons) with warm water for sore throat. I just tried it as a gargle, as I have way too much acid reflux to swallow vinegar and diabetes so I can't swallow the honey. It burned my throat so that tells me it was killing germs. I am hoping for good result. My honey is natural and raw and I would expect that to work better than processed honey due to the fact that the processed honey hasn't got much of anything but sweetness in it. I did get a good laugh at the expense of the lady who vomited the mixture and said very emphatically: "DO NOT DO", poor thing. Maybe if she could tolerate garging with it, it would help.
6812	112	7698	Shelly from Santa Barbara, Ca, USA	2008-12-07 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	As a singer, my mentor told me that ACV would cure a sore throat, and he was right. Take 2 tablespoons straight from the bottle. I did that for the first time this morning, and I have to warn you that you need a good chaser otherwise you WILL throw up on the spot. The first tablespoon I chased with water, but for the second one (taken moments after the first)water was not strong enough. Orange juice worked well for me. On the bright side, it's only been half an hour and I can talk normally and my throat hurts no more. If you can stomach this it is the most immediate remedy I've found.
6813	112	7699	Thomas from Milford, PA	2008-12-06 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	cayenne for sore throats: be careful with the cayane pepper, it makes my hemroids bleed very bad. acv and honey works well for me. I use 1 tbl spoon each in hot water, but you can use more considering how bad a sore throat you have.
6814	112	7700	Thomas from Miami, Florida	2008-11-26 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	It really works for me. I use a strong dose whenever possible. At the first signs of a strep throat or a sore throat, I make a roughly-1:1 solution of just ACV and tap water. Gargle it and sip it every hour that I'm near it. If it gets worse after a day, I change to a less-pungent mixture of 1:2 ACV and tap water. Again, gargle it and sip it each hour. It helps kill off bacteria and, for me, had pointed out where the bacteria infected. If you are well-hydrated, almost any antibacterial will work. On the final days of my sore strep throat, I had a shot of 40% ABV vodka. So long as you target the infection and stay away from other medicines (I was off Ibuprofen for several hours), you will be able to kill bacteria and relax a bit. My biggest suggestions, in addition to using apple cider vinegar, is to keep drinking. I found that peppermint gum helped relieve stuffiness, and ignoring your lack of appetite is for the best.

Still Sore Sunday morning with additional cold symptons so I went to the internet and found this site. Tried 3 tablespoons of Honey with 3 tablespoons of Apple Cider Vinager in a cup of hot water. Wow!! Pain gone before I finished the cup and a day later it has not returned. Still had cold symptons so drank the "tea" twice more and again this am. No side effects and cold symptons are minimal. One tip, hold your breath before you stick your nose of the mug, that stuff stinks.

Nothing personal...I'm just a cynic by experience but honestly must say that I have just finished my first round of "sipping" and the ACV and H20 for acute sore throat has already greatly relieved the pain, unclogged my ears, and I can actually feel my nasal passage opening! I've tried at least 5 different OTC products and all I felt was dehydrated and light-headed. My throat hurt so bad that everytime I coughed a it felt like a tree the size of my fist was trying to emerge from my stomach! AND NOW...100 percent improvement from even an hour ago! I am super grateful! I may even try to eat something later!

The last time I had sore throat, I tried HALLS cough drops and that worked really well. Now, they don't work on me anyone. I don't know why. So I tried the APPLE CIDER VINEGAR, it worked well on my sore throat and did clear my nose, but its not working on my cough as well. I hate the taste. I'm happy with the result.

Three days ago I was back in as it had come back worse than before. All he did was change the antibiotic and told me to continue to use a salt water gargle. I have hardly slept since as my throat was so sore even to swallow. I happened to come across this web site early this morning and tried the ACV and honey in warm water treatment. It worked GREAT! I used 3TBS of ACV and 3TBS of organic honey in exactly 1 cup warm water. I was nervous at first as I have GERD and IBS but it went down with no problem. My proof is in my current condition: throat pain is virtually gone and I have coughed up more crud than in the past week of taking muciinexD!!!!
6827	112	7713	Benita from Atlanta, GEORGIA	2008-09-16 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I had a very severe sore throat. I tried the ACV with honey & garlic and it helped a great deal.

My daughter has Mono and over the last 2 days has had an unbearably sore thoat. We tried everything (salt water gargle, steriod solution gargle, advil, codiene...) and nothing was working. She couldn't even swallow her saliva. It was preventing her from sleeping, and when you have mono, thats all you want to do. I happened upon this website and she gave it a shot. Using the 3 tablespoons of ACV and Honey in warm water was not particularly appetizing, but after drinking it, she was able to sleep 4 hours and now says that her throat is so much better. I am now a believer in home remedies!

She told me to add 2 tbs of acv to an 8oz glass of water, and gargle and swallow every 30 minutes. Within 5-6 hours my strep throat was completely gone. Everytime i get a sore throat, this is what i do. It tastes horrible, but helps immensily. Thank goodness for a nurse in the family!

AMAZING!!! is all I have to say. I gargled with acv, OJ, salt and warm h2o (no exact measurements I'm Italian...so a splash of this and a pinch of that)and I can't believe how quick the releif came. Thank you again. I can't wait to read some of the other remedies on your site!
6838	112	7724	Judy from Mission Viejo, CA	2008-06-21 00:00:00	NAY	1	0	I gargled with ACV the last time I had a sore throat and it worked like a charm. It seemed to "sweeten" the soreness in my throat and took out the pain. This last sore throat was so bad I could not swallow so I went for the ACV again and gargled it straight. I accidentally swallowed a gulp-full and it immediately burned and constricted my throat so I could not breathe. It was as tho I swallowed acid. I was alone and scared to death that I was just going to die on the spot. I sucked in air the best I could until I was able to fill my lungs. It was the scariest thing I ever had happen to me, I do not recommend this unless you really dilute it!! I won't ever go near it again. That episode did it for me! Be careful!

I downed a cup of tea with 3 tablespoons(yea I went heavy) of ACV and a shake of sugar. First sip was a killer, i almost yakked from the taste alone. By the 3rd sip my throat had calmed down to the point where the pain was minimal at best. I figured Id do one better and proceeded to drink 4 ounces of ACV straight! Well after I spent the next 6 hrs on the commode...the pain was gone! No kidding. This stuff really works folks.

I have been struggling with sinusitis and allergies for several months now, and believe it culminated this week into a severe sore throat. I did break down and take amoxocillin the last time (just three weeks ago) but broke out in a rash on 7th day. I am not willing to try antibiotics again so soon, so got online to see if anything could be found for relief. My throat hurt so bad 20 minutes ago, it brought back memories of a tonsillectomy in 3rd grade. I now know that sugar just feeds these things, but in order to get through my day yesterday, I had to do couph drops. So I tried the 2 tbs ACV in water(a normal sized mug) with a tbs of natural honey. IT WORKS! I am not pain free, but I can swallow without severe pain. I will be taking a large serving of this with me today! I cannot thank you enough, as I was really in panic mode. I notice now I am breaking a sweat, which I consider a good thing, toxins releasing. I will be including this in my daily regimine froom now on. I am a hygienist though, and do recommend trying it with the soda or immediately brushing your teeth thoroughly after use, as this can do severe damage to your teeth. Thanks so much, I now know I can make it through today, and that I don't have to take an antibiotic. Much relief!

It's been this way after a couple weeks and a full regiment of Penicillin. I googled about sore throats and found this site. Made me a conconction of ACV and tea and it's working surprisingly well. Use 1 cup water, throw in a teabag of earl gray tea add 2 teaspoons suger and 2 tablespoons ACV. Seems to be working for me, hope it works for others too.

I have gargled several times today with warm salt water. When I found this website I tried 3 Tbs. ACV,3 Tbs.honey,and 6 oz.warm water. My throat has already eased. thank you so much.
6843	112	7729	Bob from London, Canada	2008-05-21 00:00:00	NAY	1	0	Sore Throat Remedies: Every site I looked at said ACV really works...... WRONG! I used 2 tbsp in 1 cup of warm water, gargled it. My throat hurt even more after that. I went to the hospital it hurt so bad. Was told it wasn't strep, just very very red and inflamed. the ACV actually burnt my throat. I am finally starting to feel a little better after 5 days. So in my opinion stick to the salt and water solution and avoid the ACV.

My sore throat started only a day ago and has gotten so bad that it hurt to drink water and talk. It just woke me up at 3am (as I write this). So I searched and found this site. As a Nurse Practitioner I have been educated about all the different meds out there, but lack the education in any herbal remedies (which would have been nice). Though I do recommend that for any sore throat lasting over a week, or if you are unable to talk or breath, or if you have white patches on your throat in the mouth, seek help from your health care provider...anyway, the point is that the ACV remedy worked for me! I dropped about 2 Table Spoons of ACV with a Table Spoon or two (depending on taste) in some water and heat it up...I have been sipping on it while typing this and am now able to swallow my spit without wincing...it isn't completely gone, but maybe now I can get some sleep.
6845	112	7731	Jesse from Seattle, WA	2008-04-12 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Absolutely speechless! My sore throat came on fast over the course of 1 day. By the end of the first night, it proved to be the worst I've had to date. skeptical, but desporate, I thought if its a bad idea, it wont hurt much worse. I just mixed apx 3 tsp in some normal tea, I've taken 4 sips while writing this and I already feel so much better, not gone, but mild enough to live with. Sounds scary, but you'll be very plesantly suprised. This is one chance you wont regret taking.

My car has been acting funny so I couldn't drive to a store to buy medicine. I found this website and we happen to have ACV in the cabinet. I mixed two tablespoons of that with a half cup of warm water which he sipped slowly. He felt a little relief after two minutes. The rest of the night he drank cinnamon tea with a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar and was all better.

I've been sipping on the ACV, honey, and orange juice for about 30 min now and my throat is feeling a lot better. I can actually swallow my own saliva again.
6849	112	7735	Antonio from Perth, Western Australia	2008-03-13 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have been battling with a frustrating sore throat for the past few days now , just began with the usuals such as warm teas with honey and whatnot , though it did not seem to work at all . I then went to my pharmacist tried a throat gargle and and an antiseptic lozenge for half a day without any improvement . I woke at midnight ( tonight ) with a throat i could not swallow or speak with , i was even considering going to the hospital before bumping into this site which seemed to be quite helpful from the off set . I gathered that this cayenne powder worked , though i did not have any on hand so i found a trend of anything hot would be beneficial in relieving a sore throat . So i found some curry powder , initially i put in a few teaspoons to a glass of warm water and only gargled , it was annoying hot though i i didn't swallow , so i tried a teaspoon of black pepper with the curry, gargled and swallowed ... i coughed and choked as well as various burning sensations deep within the affected area . I then read on another post about someone sipping tablespoons of vinegar, took two tablspoons initially ... they went down well with more of a stinging knife poking sensation in my throat , so i finished up taking one more ... I can swallow to a degree , stuffiness in my head has subsided , though i will check in the morning to see how i feel.

I've had a nasty sore throat for weeks. Throat cultures by the ENT revealed nothing out of the ordinary. I tried the ACV remedy but by the following day, the pain in my throat intensified. In search of some relief, I ventured to the health food store. I'm now using a Propolis throat spray (alcohol free). I felt much better after the first application. Things are improving nicely. Good luck to all.

I have finally lost my patience with it and I went online this morning to see if I could find something to fix it.. Thank You Thank You for this site.. I found the ACV, some lemon juice and a drop of honey. Warmed up the mix and gargled, gargled and gargled some more. Now I have a little cup to sip on. It is feeling some better, not a whole lot, but I just started. Heck any relief right now I am satisfied with. Oh definitely keep a glass of water near by so you dont get dehydrated or if you choke.
6851	112	7737	Janice from Pensacola, FL, USA	2008-02-25 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I discovered the wonders of ACV a few months ago. My husband caught a viral infection and was so sick he lost 2 days work, after two weeks he was still sick and I got a scratchy throat by the 3rd day I could barely talk or eat it hurt so bad. My Mom suggested I try ACV and honey mixed together and take 1 TBL 3 times a day. I was desperate so I tried it. 1 spoon in the morning and wow did it burn my throat I had to drink some water to stop the burn, I had 3 spoons of the ACV and honey mixture and that evening my sore throat was gone!!! My husband refused to try it and a few days later he called me from work and said he was going to the ER because he felt so sick. He was sent home with a prescription. I told him just try the ACV and honey, you have been sick all this time but I was sick only 3 days, just try it! He did and it worked, he never filled the prescription. I plan on buying some unprocessed ACV to treat other health problems I have. ACV is a wonder.
6852	112	7738	Melissa from Tifton, georgia	2008-02-20 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I found that dreams do come true.Ive had the sore throat for three agonizing days and i seen where it said ACV can get read of sore throat. So i gave it a try.So ive taken 1tsp of ACV vinegar, half of orange juice sweezed, salt (desired amount) with hot water works best for me.i gargle with it and it cleared the mucus in my throat and cured my sore throat within 10 minutes.It really works! Thanks for sharing this with me and to the world. People you really need to try it.
6853	112	7739	Jennifer from Rockford, Illinois	2008-01-06 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I am very predisposed to having cold, sinusitis, bronchitis, and up til now, I have taken probably 1/2 dozen different antibiotics, nasal and oral inhalers, and decongestants. Taking so much at once tended to make me feel worse, and the inhalers ultimately irritated my sinuses. I finally tried a couple different acv recipes to relieve my cough and sore throat. I have not taken one prescription since, and I'm having trouble less often. As soon as I feel a tickle in my throat, I reach straight for the acv. My preferred recipe is 3 parts acv, 3 parts lemon juice, and 2 parts honey with a shot or so of hot water to help dissolve the honey. I've read that organic would be better, but I've just used the standard grocery store stuff, and it's still been nothing short of miraculous. The taste is honestly not as bad as any cough syrup or decongestant I've ever taken, and it's easily twice as effective. The tickle in my chest that precedes a serious coughing fit is STOPPED ALTOGETHER before I even finish drinking this. I am still sort of stunned at how effective this is. Last night I didn't get a chance to mix up a little thermos to bring to work with me, and I regretted it this morning. The congestion in my chest had built up during the evening and overnight, and this morning the cough had settled in a bit. I've been taking a dose every couple of hours, or whenever that tickle comes back, and I've already gotten a lot of congestion out of my chest and sinuses, and my ears have cleared out and everything. This is the most phenomenal and fastest-working remedy I've ever used. I've been spreading the word to my friends and family since. I'll never take decongestants again! Thank you from the bottom of my heart!
6854	112	7740	Maureen from Cambridgeshire, England	2007-12-31 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I had a sore throat for about 4 days and the tickly cough was driving me crazy. In desperation I trawled the internet and found your site and the ACV remedy. Luckily I had a bottle of ACV in the cupboard and so I tried it with honey dissolved in a small amount of water. It was horrible to swallow but the results were almost instant. The annoying cough has now mostly gone and I had a good nights sleep. My throat still feels a little 'lumpy' but its bearable now. Thanks to all who posted the remedy.
6855	112	7741	Deb from San Antonio, Texas	2007-12-27 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Wow, I already feel some improvement!! I found this website out of desperation as I would much rather try something homeopathic than have to go see a Dr. Have had a sore throat for the last 2 days and it got to the point that I could not even swallow my own saliva with out discomfort or cringing (ms). I tried the ACV, honey and water method and felt instant relief. I will keep sipping throughout the day. Just in the last couple of sips I already feel better. It is the holiday season and I want to be able to eat delicious food and not just soup!!! Thanks for this website. By the way, why is the vinegar bad for teeth?
6856	112	7742	Nick from Halifax, NS, Canada	2007-12-26 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I am 21 and have been taking ACV for about a month now and I have noticed a increase in energy especially after I take it. Most of all it made my allergies and fluid build up (around throat and sinus) almost disapper. I swig oragnic pure ACV (with mother) strait from the bottle. I try to ingest only a tablespoon each time. Then rinse my mouth with water (to protect teeth) then drink a big glass of water. I try to do it twice daily. My bother asked my if I had any cough drops when he was at my house not long ago and I said no but you can try some of this ACV. He tryed a little swig and he said it instanly took his sore thoat away. It makes your senses almost come alive, it's the real deal.
6857	112	7743	Kelly from Seattle, WA, U.S.A	2007-11-17 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Yes, I felt instant relief. After spraying my mouth with cloraseptic spray, gargling with salt, drinking tea all in sequence. I went online and found this remedy, and I was skeptical at first. Mostly just scared of potential burning sensation on my throat. But I just mixed ACV with water, waited a bit, and I feel much better. My breathing has improved too. I'm looking forward to a good night of rest! Thank you.

I have had a sore throat for two days along with discomfort in my chest due to a dry cough. I am sipping on a cup of your "cure" as I type. I feel a slight tingle but no burning. The taste leaves room for desire but, I can survive it. I am getting ready for bed so I will let you know how I feel tomorrow. Keeping my fingers crossed for a good night sleep.

6861	112	7747	Rob from Ocala, florida	2007-09-01 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Okay, so my wife has me all paranoid about this volcano of a sore throat I've had for four days, so bad I can't even sleep at night and now I'm starting to get a little worried. I get online and come to this site to see if there is anything I can do before going to a doctor on Tuesday. I read about using apple cider vinegar and go on the hunt in the kitchen to see if we have some at 1am, I find it and mix like 2 tbsp of it with one cup of water and start gargling. At first it kind of burned, but I stayed consistent and gargled about every hour and a half. It's now 7am and I only feel a little bit of an ache in my throat. This will be one I use from now on and make my kids use in the future. Thanks for the info, maybe tonight I will get some sleep.
6862	112	7748	Bob from SLC, UT	2007-07-03 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Apple cider vinegar cured my sore throat. I had a sore throat for the last 2 days and woke up at 4 am this morning it hurt so bad I could hardly swallow. After searching for remedies I found this site and read about apple cider vinegar and made a tea with 3 Tbsp of apple cider vinegar 3 Tbsp lemon juice 2 Tbsp of honey and 16 oz. water, then I heated it to sipping temperature. Its almost 6 am now and my sore throat is nearly gone.
6863	112	7749	Helen from Stroud, England	2007-06-20 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have used the following recipe for my throat whenever it feels sore or tired. I am a singer and so it has been really helpful to have an easy natural remedy to use. Heat up 1 desert spoon of cider vinegar, about 1 cm fresh ginger, chopped, in water (enough for one or two drinks depending on how strong you like it). Strain the drink into a cup and add one teaspoon of honey. Drink while still warm.
6864	112	7750	Roxanne from Las Pinas, Philippines	2007-05-15 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I was looking for a cure for my sore throat when i came across your website with remedies for my ailment. The moment I read that apple cider vinegar is used to cure sore throats, i ran to the kitchen to find some! By the grace of God, I had all the ingredients except the lemon juice which i substituted with calamansi juice. I'm drinking it now and my sore throat is going away faster than i expected! I thank God for all of you! Thank you so much!!! God bless!
6865	112	7751	Michael from Placerville, California	2007-05-08 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	First, one point must be made. Apple Cider Vinegar kills every germ, bacteria, and virus ON CONTACT!!!So if you travel into a foreign country where the water might not be the healthiest, and concuming the food there might also be seriously questionable, take a tablespoon of Apple Cider Vinegar before ingesting any food. If you do develope food poisoning from food or water, throw down just one tablespoon of Apple Cider Vinegar and within a short time the miseries will be gone. Too strong to just gulp it down? Take a cup of very hot water and add one tablespoon of honey and add to it three tablespoons of Apple Cider Vinegar. Stir until the honey is dissolved, then add a little cool water so you do not burn your mouth, and drink it. For a sore throat - make the same mixture of hot water, honey and cider vinegar, and then SIP - DO NOT GULP IT DOWN. The sore throat will be gone overnight, because every time you SIP the mixture, it washes down your throat and kills more and more of the infection. At first you will feel the sting of it working, but quickly that goes away and the throat begins to feel much, much better. For a good and sound night's sleep? Slowly drink the mixture and go to bed. Why? Your chemistry is different between first thing in the morning and at bedtime, so at night the drink will help you achieve a peaceful and sound sleep, and then in the morning drink it and it will give you a shot of energy! I hope all this helps someone. It has helped me for the past fifteen years.

Today is new years eve, and what does everyone do on this night, party. I definitely did not want to stay home sucking on cough drops all night while everyone one was having fun. So i look online for cures, i saw this one and it worked! I tried it and I started to feel better instantly!
6867	112	7753	Elizabeth from Bayside, NY	2006-07-12 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I've been reading about ACV in a few health/diet books for the past 2 years. But, I thought I'd rather die than drink vinegar. But, one night I had the worst sore throat ever. It was 6:30 on a Friday night so out of desperation I gargled with it on and off for two hours. Can I tell you that the worst sore throat I have ever had was cured by this method. I also drank hot tea, with organic raw honey, lemon, and ACV. It was soothing and I figured I was cleansing my body too. My sore throat was one of those where you can't even swallow your own saliva and you just have to keep spitting it out. Gross but true. Since I knew the Drs. were closed and I would have to wait til Monday I decided to give it a go. W/in 20 min, my throat cleared up. It was an incredible miracle. I'm the first to admit that a lot of stuff is quacky. However, I have turned my beliefs into knowing the true and earthclinic is more truth than I have read in a long time. Thanks readers! and Ted from Bangkok. Thanks and much love

I am also lactose intolerant, and by taking 2tbsp ACV in Punch and a glass of lactaid i no longer have the effects I used to have, it has also helped me regain my energy, and lose weight! I feel better than I have in years!!! P.S. putting the ACV in fruit punch almost completely covers the taste.

Went to the doctors and got a throat culture said it was fine and no strep throat. i said ok but why does it still hurt. 3 days later it got worse -- lemon and honey didn't work... went back to hospital. Cussed the hell out of the doctor, already spent 200 dollars and lost 15 pounds in 3 days. Could not eat or drink. Put me on antibiotics... still no fix in 3 days said will cure up in 24hrs. I tried the vinegar apple cider. 8 hrs later i was able to swallow and chew foods. Thanks for everything.

SO I COMBINED THEM ALL TOGETHER. 8 OUNCES OF HOT WATER AND 4 TBS OF ACV, 2TBS HONEY, SEVERAL DROPS OF TOBASCO, 2 CLOVES OF GARLIC 1/2 TEASPOON OF CAYENNE. I STINK BUT I FEEL GREAT! VERY POWERFUL DRINK BUT NOT SO TASTY AND YOU HAVE TO KEEP STIRING SO NOTHING SETTLES.

It always took the sting out and healed quickly. Then, I stumbled on your site (thank goodness!) for some tips on relieving my cold and sore throat (mixing ACV with lemon and honey and drinking it with warm water). I am pregnant and unable to take much cough/cold medicine and needed to find an alternative. This helped immensely and I wasn't in a fog like most cold medicines put you in. The sore throat was gone overnight and the cold a few days later.
6872	112	7758	Sierra from La Mesa, CA	2006-05-02 00:00:00	NAY	1	0	for the past week i have had the worst sore throat i can imagine. i would cringe every time i had to swallow, and the left side of the back of my throat was swelled up and almost kinda blue. i have been on aspirin most of the time and that almost makes it completely die down, however it doesn't cure it at ALL. i thought it went away 3 days ago but yesterday i discovered i had it back again. i tried the ACV w/ water and a little honey but couldn't even keep my mouth open long enough to gargle it. then i tried the cajan (sp?) pepper, and that felt like it was going to do something but nothing so far. my best bet right now is aspirin, as sad as that is, and a little honey helps soothe it every now and then. i still have yet to try the lemon but i've found that hot soup is always a nice option.
6873	112	7759	Patricia from Mayfield Heights, Ohio	2006-04-24 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	ACV vapors cured a very bad sore throat that was back behind my left ear. I have a deviated septum so, I felt very positive about inhaling the fumes of the cider vinegar. I figured this would be better than the saline spray I had been using for 2 days. Within minutes I was able to cough up and blow a lot of mucus from my nasal passage!! and my throat....WAS BACK TO NORMAL!!!! Thank YOU SO MUCH!!. All of you guys and ladies who took the time to put your comments and results on this site. I hope I have helped someone with my results as well. I love this site!!

At first, I only received slight relief from my sore throat, but after about the third cup, I was feeling much better. Tried the tomato tea too but wasn't quite as good as I had hoped. Love your website.

Didn't make it so bad, plus it isn't so bad for your teeth enamel that way. It works!!
6877	112	7763	Samantha from Eleebana NSW	2006-02-13 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Salty Water is a great one but it take too long. Vinegar and honey actually works quiet well it may be the most disgusting thing on the planet but it works. Just remember to take sips of water in between taking the remedy.
6878	112	7764	Kim G from Tampa Bay, FL	2006-02-06 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Yesterday I came down with an awful sore throat, accompanied with a nagging cough and chills. My throat literally felt like it was on fire. I did a search and found this page. I've used it for many things, but I would have never thought about Apple Cider Vinegar for a sore throat. Although I don't make a habit of it, I am one of the few people that can drink Apple Cider Vinegar straight. Anyway, being concerned about the tooth enamel thing, I went ahead and poured Apple Cider Vinegar in a shot glass, drank it like a sailor and washed it down with spring water afterward. I did this about once every hour for approximately six hours. Here I am, six hours later, and I can actually swallow without cringing. My sore throat is manageable and my accompanied cough has also calmed down. Thanks for the tip!

6880	112	7766	Robert from Queens, NY	2006-01-30 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Since there are so many chemicals in what we eat, and the pharmaceutical companies are making millions from us. I have decided to go natural with certain things. Yesterday a friendly cashier coughed in my direction. That night I suffered from the most horrible sore throat and nasal congestion I have ever had. After a little research I took ACV with warm water, gargled at first then drank the rest. If you want a quick natural cure, this is the way to go. Not only did my sore throat go away, but my entire nasal cavity was drained. (Sorry) no infection, thank god, some ear wax came out without any trouble. Cheap, and no doctor visit. They are going to have to get money from someone else.

I had to teach a class next day and I was worried. Googled and found your website. Tried the ACV (Heinz, 5% acidity) lime juice  Local-make clover honey  warm water followed by rinsing my mouth to remove the acid (for my teeth). It was effective immediately! I was able to teach the next day! Thank you! I also had 5 fresh raw Basil leaves twice a day. Helped me with my cold and cough. And about 2 brown dried dates for strength.

I woke up with a terrible sore throat this morning and it has lasted all day - 5 mins ago my voice was croaky and horribly sore. I just gargled Apple Cider Vinegar and chili pepper diluted with water and I feel better already! My voice is almost back to normal! Thank you so much!

Finally went to an ENT who put the camera up my nose and down my throat and saw that there was no infection. As it turns out he diagnosed it as acid reflux! So he put me on a reflux regimen and started me on AcipHex which I tried for a week to no avail. Then I tried Nexium out of pocket since it was not covered in my insurance formulary, and in about a day and a half, it was gone! Hope this helps someone!

6886	113	7772	Brice from Sringfield, USA	2007-05-16 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I've had my fare share of sore throats, and I find that taking one capsule (1 billion count of organisms) of Acidophilus plus one 200mg of Ibuprofen every 4 hours helps with the pain.THIS IS JUST A SUGGESTION. This works for me, but may cause further health problems in others. Acidophilus is a probiotic, which means you shouldn't take it with antibiotics. Acidolphilus contains the same Lactobacillus (rod-shaped bacteria) found in milk or cheese. The breakdown of nutrients by Lactobacillus Acidophilus produces lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide, and other byproducts that make the environment hostile for undesired organisms. Acidolphilus is not recognized by the FDA to cure any disease. Ibuprofen helps in reducing the swelling. Ibuprofen is a blood thinner and shouldn't be used with other blood thinners. Ibuprofen has also been known to cause stomach pains and stomach bleeding. If stomach pains occur, drinking milk may help. READ THE DRUG FACTS LABEL.

I woke up this morning at 6 AM with a sore throat, sneezing, and a runny nose... Like the river Euphrates (seriously)... And I just felt "sick"... Like a cold, I guess. I had to blow my nose about 1, 000 times, non-stop. So I did a couple shots (cap-fulls) of Apple Cider Vinegar and then immediately took some pictures of my face to commemorate the event. Then I mixed a quarter (1/4) teaspoon of Cayenne Pepper into a quarter (1/4) cup of water and gargled it in small doses (and spit it out) several times and also drank some (and I took some more pictures of my face). Then I blew my nose another thousand times, non-stop. That was 2 hours ago and my nose stopped running and now it is 95% clear, and my sore throat is 95% gone. And I don't feel sick anymore. Sweet! Now I can go to work! Word of caution: these things are not fun to drink, but it only feels annoying for a few minutes... And well worth it! Don't be a sissy, do it! (Nothing personal against sissies)

6889	113	7775	Suzanne from Norman, Ok	2012-06-01 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	After two days of an extremely painful sore throat I was desperate for relief. After reading the posts I tried many combinations but this is what worked for me: 1 cup ACV undiluted, 2 tbs raw honey and 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper. I gargled with this mixture and felt immediate improvement. I contined to gargle (not drink) this about every two hours, rinsing my mouth with plenty of plain water after each use. Within less than 24 hours my sore throat had vanished, my voice came back and I was able to swallow without pain. Many thanks to all who posted.

My sore throat is temporarily numbed for a while so I did use it regularly when I was coming down with something, but I don't know what is so wonderful about it. I use the organic.

One bag of Celestial Seasonings Mandarin Orange Spice, 3 table spoons ACV, 1/8 measure of cayenne pepper with hot water {from tea pot heated on stove}8 or 10 oz cup. I don't believe anything should come out of a micro wave. It worked almost instantly and is loosening the mucus. EARTH CLINIC RULES... LOVE THIS WEBSITE, NEVER GIVE UP. THANKS.
6894	113	7780	Drew from Salina, Kansas	2008-03-27 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have had a sore throat for a couple days now. Probably worsened by the fact that outside of death I won't go to the doctor. Put 8 oz. water, 1/4 tsp. of cayenne, splash of ACV and some honey in a cup and then in the microwave for a minute. Sipped/gargled this for half an hour. Amazing!!! I can actually swallow not with no pain! Thank you so much!!
6895	113	7781	Eloise from New York, NY	2008-03-18 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I tried the ACV/Cayenne Pepper remedy as suggested by Laura for the severe sore throat that I was having thanks to all my allergies and post nasal drip. I put two tablespoons of ACV, two tablespoons of honey, and 1/8 tsp of cayenne pepper in a cup of boiled hot water. I drank it and then it worked a bit but I could still feel the daggers in my throat everytime I cleared my throat, so I just went to bed. Today, my sore throat is GONE, and my runny nose has changed to a congested nose which isn't ideal, but baby steps! Also, for some reason, I noticed that after I drank the cayenne pepper, my saliva started becoming really thick so I would constantly spit it out. Whats that about?
6896	113	7782	Annette from Coolah, Australia	2008-03-15 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	James' recipe & cayenne pepper cured my sore throat. Brilliant information - thanks! I was quite desperate yesterday morning with a throat that was severely swollen and each swallow felt as though it was against razor blades. I had been gargling with apple cider vinegar for a day already but although it relieved it slightly immediately it definitely wasn't improving. I read the most popular cure (Penny's) of cayenne pepper in water and used a spare eyedropper to squirt small amounts of this down to the back of my throat - ooooh, hot, nasty taste, but it relieved it slightly. I repeated every 15-20 minutes for a couple of hours and it felt slightly better. I continued regularly doing this and about 4 hours after beginning tried James' recipe - 12oz water, 4oz apple cider vinegar, 1/2 tspn cayenne and some honey (I used 2 heaped teaspoons), heated and sipped. It tasted foul and made me feel quite ill, so I stopped sipping and used it as a gargle instead. I gargled every hour or so with this mixture and in between used the cayenne/water mixture squirted to the back of the throat. Within about 8 hours of starting the remedy it was feeling substantially better and now 24 hours later has almost completely gone. Thanks!!!
6916	113	7800	Carissa from Pewee Valley, KY	2007-03-30 00:00:00	NAY	1	0	1:00AM - Well, after a week of having a sore throat, gargling with anything hot or cold, taking antibiotics "just in case", and having visited your site twice, I broke down and went for the cayenne pepper cure. So far, I can't tell much difference. My mouth is on fire (I have a low tolerance to hot foods!) and that is at the very least taking my mind off my throat. I will gargle again in a few minutes. I really need to get some GOOD sleep. 1:15AM - Just gargled again and took a sip and swallowed. My lips, mouth and throat are on fire. I am out of milk now, so that is the last i will try for the night! Honestly, at this moment, it doesn't feel any better than it did. Maybe overnight it will feel better. Good luck to you all!
6897	113	7783	Jennifer from Mesquite, Texas	2008-03-08 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I must have had the worst sore throat in history. I have had three babies, and several tooth infections, but nothing compared to the pain of this sore throat! I went to the doctor and it was confirmed viral. The only thing they could do was give me pain meds. So guess what I was given...codine...in syrup form! Why would anyone in their right mind give someone with an extreme sore throat syrup to gag down?!?! Anyway, it didnt touch the pain. I was double dosing and begging my husband to knock me out...for real. He wouldn't, so in desperation, I got online and started searching for natural cures. At 2 a.m. I found earthclinic! I didnt have apple cider vinegar, but I had powdered cayene pepper in the kitchen, so i mixed it with warm water and oh praise the Lord...the pain was decreasing! I cried and cried from sheer relief. I would gargle it for 30 seconds or so every 15 minutes. After about 3 hours, I was feeling waaaay better and could sleep finally. After I woke up, I started drinking ACV in green tea with lemon and honey and cayene pepper. I didn't have to gargle anymore after that. I would just drink the acv cayene concoction all day.After 24 hours,I was completely normal!
6898	113	6739	Lisa	2008-02-01 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	At 1:00 this morning, I finally got out of bed because my sore throat was making me miserable. It has been sore for a few days but it had finally reached it's peak. I couldn't swallow and was almost in tears. I sat down in front of the computer and researched home made remedies until I came across your site and the recipe for ACV, Cayenne pepper, honey and water. After I read all of the Yea's, I decided I certainly didn't have anything to lose. I didn't have any cayenne pepper but I did have some hot sauce with cayenne listed as the main ingredient of 3 so I used 1/2 teaspoon of that instead and I added a small amount of sea salt. Here are the results: It didn't taste terrific... obviously. But it wasn't horrid either. I only finished about 12 of the 16 ounces because I was starting to get a little nauseated. I am assuming that is from lack of food in my stomach though. It took me about 40 minutes to drink that because I waited a few minutes in between each sip. I gargled and swallowed each drink. My first surprise was that immediately, I started having tons of mucus come up. I haven't been congested so I was a little shocked. And, I was disappointed that it really didn't feel better quickly. I went back to bed and then my nose started running...again, surprised since I hadn't thought that was an issue. I did finally fall asleep. I awoke again around 4:30...and was AMAZED in the difference in my throat. While it was still a little sore, the change was dramatic! I could swallow without total agony. It is now 8:00 and it my throat is a little sore but nothing like it was. I am headed downstairs to make another batch of this stuff because I am sure it can only help. THANKS so much! Lisa
6899	113	7784	Jason from Mammoth, Cali	2008-01-27 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Kudos to the nice site! I hope this helps many people as it did me. Four days ago, I woke up with a little tickle of a sore throat. By yesterday it had become absolutely atrocious. I got desperate, found this site, and went to the store and bought some apple cider vinegar and cayenne powder last night. I have chili powder and balsamic vinegar at home, but figured I should try the exact recipe. I've almost finished a pint of acv and a couple teaspoons (haven't been measuring) of cayenne. compared to yesterday, I feel wonderful! I was getting fever/chills for the last two days, and that's done too. I've also been taking lots of astragalus, echinacea, and goldenseal. So, although I may be in the same shape today if I didn't take anything at all, I am convinced that the cayenne/acv soothed the pain and irritation in my throat. Maybe it helped me along in other ways, too, but who knows... I was very skeptical to try this, as I almost always get hiccups when I eat anything spicy, and I really didn't want to be hiccuping with a sore throat. I started with five "bottom taps" of cayenne per serving (and oh yes did it make me hiccup), and am now up to fifteen taps per serving (without hiccups), which include about two eyeballed-tablespoons ACV and hot water. Mmmm, mmmm, good! Thank you so very much!!!

I was pretty skeptical at first, but when the pain got bad enough I was up for giving anything a try. I have gargled it twice in the last hour an a half and I'm feeling pretty much better.

I tried ACV and hot water (2 1) plus 1/8 tsp cayenne and 2 tbsp honey last week for a sore throat that I had had for 2 days. My wife had a sore throat first and went to the Dr and was given amoxicillan. I didn't gargle I drank it. I had relief in 24 hours and it was gone in 36! My wife still had hers . . 'nuff said!

6958	115	7828	Renee from Melbourne Beach, FL	2008-04-11 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	A few month ago, I came down with a sore throat. That afternoon I grabbed some salsa and tortilla chips as a snack - my sore throat was gone almost instantly! After coming across your website, now everything makes sense. Since most salsas have vinegar, garlic & spices in them, this is a great snack for anyone to grab with a sore throat - only have mild salsa on hand: spinkle cayenne pepper in it and voila!
6905	113	7789	Amy from New York, NY	2007-09-23 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Cayenne pepper and ACV cured my sore throat. I get really bad sore throats once or twice a year. Last time, I tried swallowing pieces of garlic, and ginger tea with honey, lemon juice, and a little cayenne pepper. It worked somewhat, but I still had to go in for anitbiotics in the end. This time, I talked to my dad and he told me about this site, and told me to try Apple Cider Vinegar, Cayenne pepper, and hot water. The first sip was weird, but now I like the taste, I think the vinegar goes well with the pepper (better than the honey and lemon juice did!), and it does taste like wing sauce. It burned a little, and my throat felt better within minutes. I just keep a cup nearby and take a sip every 15 minutes or so (stirring well each time). Normally the sore throat is worst in the morning, but the next day it felt almost 100% better. Thanks!!!
6906	113	7790	Mark from Wexford Town, Ireland	2007-09-07 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I went in search of a sore throat remedy on the internet in desperation after 5 dreadful days and sleepless nites. Having been at the doc and exhausting all the anti-biotics he had given me without any sign of my burning throat being cured.I then found your site and found the remedy for sore throats.Using cayenne pepper apple cider vinegar and honey mixed in warm water and used as a mouthwash. Sceptical i was but also desperate to rid myself of the extreme pain and discomfort i was feeling.So i went to the local 24hr store and bought the ingredients.I then made the remedy and gargled as instructed.Man is that cayenne hot! But unbelievably after the initial discomfort disappeared my throat felt almost normal again. I could gulp without being in agony. Will continue to use at the prescribed intervals indicated on your site. All i can say is thank you so much. Wot a cure!

Yes, it does taste like buffalo wing sauce (minus the wings, of course!) but it has realy calmed my throat pain and is breaking up my congestion. I hope the effects will continue!
6908	113	7792	Martha from Milwaukee, Wisconsin	2007-07-29 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I periodically come down with truly horrible sore throats - can't swallow; talk and even hurts to breathe. I've always gone to the doctor for antibiotics. This time I had to go to Urgent Care last weekend because the pain was unbearable. I was given a 3-day course of antibiotics which seemed to work until I ran out and could feel the soreness returning by mid-week. Today I woke up with the same nightmarish pain. Reluctant to make another trip to Urgent Care, I searched this site and found the ACV/Cayenne recipe. In desperation, I dragged myself to the store for the ingredients and brewed up a cup. The first sip was a little shocking, but I persevered. As I write this it's been about a half an hour and the pain is noticeably diminished. I will carry on and probably try the gargle as well. So far, I am really amazed!
6909	113	7793	Debbie from Danville, Virginia	2007-07-03 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Within minutes of trying ACV and pepper, my sore throat was soothed and congestion began breaking up. I tried James tea recipe but found that ice water, ACV, and various dashes of Texas Pete were more effective for me. I had two small cups before I left work and felt almost well. I continued drinking small cups through the next day and was relieved of bronchitis and sore throat days before my co-workers and family had any relief with their prescription meds. When I felt well enough to go to the store to purchase cayenne pepper, I no longer needed it. Having to substitute Texas Pete for the cayenne pepper didn't lessen the effectiveness. I am really, really glad to have found this and will definitely use it in the future at the first sign of illness.

Last night I noticed I had a sore throat, so tried gargling peroxide to avoid infection and clear anything out, but to no avail still woke up with a sore throat. I went to work, could barely talk, found your site in desperation and decided to pick up the ingredients for the ACV   Cayenne tea. AND WOW, JUST WOW. I gargled the pepper, every 15 minutes while I sipped on the tea and in about 15 minutes, it was all but gone. My voice is back and the pain is barely there. Excellent remedy! Thanks again!

So I made a "tea" of 2 Tablespoons cider vinegar, a 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper, a slice of ginger, a little honey and water. Boiled it for 4 minutes, cooled and gargled it, swallowing small amounts periodically. I woke up the next morning and my sore throat was gone. Thank you.

I just whipped up a batch of James' "tea" and my throat already feels 100% better! It even tastes good! My hubby had a taste and he even liked it!

6913	113	7797	Kerry from Brooklyn, NY	2007-05-11 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Cayenne pepper with apple cider vinegar and honey helped my sore throat! I've always had allergies, but all of a sudden, this year, they just knocked me off my feet. I've been suffering from all sorts of sinus problems and stuffy nose and problems breathing. Most of the other stuff I've found help for, but the one lingering thing was my sore throat (brought on by post nasal drip, in case you were wondering). While I know I can't completely get rid of it until I manage to get rid of my allergies, it was so bad that I was actually grinding my teeth when swallowing. So I tried gargling with cayenne, and that helped a little. But the hot water with ACV, honey & cayenne was like a god-send. My throat is not completely better, but at least I can go to bed without worrying about not being able to swallow! I'm going to keep this up until my allergies are gone! Thank yoU!

There is a burn, and I am still sipping. The house smells like I am canning pickles or something... LOL Have had a terrible sore throat the last two days/nights, typed in a search for some relief and found a wealth of info, I am still sipping... almost reminds me of when my mom would make watermelon rind pickles and this is the brine, minus the 'hot'. Okay, I just did a 'hard swallow' and I think it is better, it is not gone, but I still have at least a good cup to go, might take me awhile, was hoping for instant relief. I will stop my rambling and get to sipping.

She's been in so much pain with a sore throat. We tried the old "salt water" gargle but to no avail. When I told her about your remedy recipe she was like "no way!". I then said I would do if first and then she agreed to try after me. She said it was like "soup" and said it tasted like Buffalo wings! She actually liked it and said I should make it with tacos as a soup- amazing! She did it only once so far and says it has already helped! With the recipe you give, it's enough for several uses and I will do it every 15 min. to a 1/2 hour till she tells me it's all gone! Praise to holistic home remedies!

All of the head colds I have had in the last 9 years have started with a sore throat. I have had Strep the last 3 times. I gargled with Cayenne Pepper, ground, and apple cider. I could not get to the sore area with gargling so I mixed the two. Gargle first and slowly let it trickle down your throat. Be careful not to inhale it ! I did and it is like tear gas! Anyway, it worked flat out, no questions. I had the throat for 4 days and killed it in 2 using Pepper and Apple cider. It didn't taste too bad either, but it did the Job! I have 2 jars of pepper ready to go !! Thank you from the bottom of my heart!!

I felt really sick and when I got home I slept for 12 hours and just whined the whole time. I finally found this site and my dad took me to Ralphs to get ACV and Cayenne Pepper. I'm using it now and its helping me. To tell the truth, I don't like the taste very much but it is helping and I want it to go away so I can go to school tomorrow.
6921	113	7805	Carol from Elmwood Park, NJ	2007-02-13 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Sunday I awoke with the most painful sore throat of my entire life. I couldn't swallow at all. Talking was painful. Sunday I bought an OTC spray Chloraseptic for my throat. Worked a little and then not at all. By Monday morning, I was in complete agony!!! Then I found this website... I followed the remedy of the sore throat tea. I boiled about 12 oz water and added capful of ACV, large heaping tablespoon of honey, 1/2 lemon squeezed and 1/4 tsp of Cheyenne pepper. Immediately with the first cup it soothed my sore throat and I was able to swallow again. I let the hot liquid lay in my throat for a few long seconds before swallowing. The pain came back after about an hour and I made more tea. Altogether I had about 4 cups throughout the day. It is now Tuesday morning and the pain is almost completely gone!!! I can swallow today! WOW!!, that's amazing to work that quick and that great. It's only been 24 hours and I can swallow without that terrible knife pain in my throat! Thank you Earth Clinic for this website! I will recommend you to everyone. Thank you

I TRIED THE REMEDY OF CAYENNE WITH WATER, GARGLING IT EVERY 15 MINUTES. HOWEVER IT WAS TOO HOT FOR ME TO CONTINUE PAST THE FIRST TRY. THEN I DECIDED TO TRY THE REMEDY OF WATER WITH ACV... AND IT WORKED WONDERS, MY SORE THROAT VANISHED WITHIN A FEW DAYS. I THEN RECOMMENDED IT TO MY FAMILY WHEN THEY CAME DOWN WITH A BAD SORE THROAT THAT HAD LASTED FOR MORE THEN A WEEK. THEY TRIED IT ALSO AND TO THEIR AMAZEMENT, IT WORKED IN A FEW DAYS. THANKS SO MUCH FOR THIS REMEDY. I ALSO HAVE HEARD ACV IS GOOD FOR WEIGHT LOSS, I INTEND TO TRY THIS IN THE FUTURE FOR THIS REASON.
6923	113	7638	Laurie from Corona, CA	2006-12-31 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I got sick Christmas Day and Could not talk. My throat was on fire it felt like it was closing up and I couldn't hardly swallow. I used the cayenne pepper remedy and it was still real bad. I got thirsty after all that hot pepper gargling so I drank some ice cold water which I thought was going to make it worse. Almost immediately my sore throat went away and it never returned. My son 15 yrs old got sick with a sore throat the next day and couldn't hardly swallow. I told him to try the cold water and his throat stopped hurting also, but it started hurting again hours later so we're going to repeat the water and gargle with cayenne pepper and APV remedy. This is much cheaper that all the medication I use to buy every time one of my 4 kids gets sick. I love this site, I hope you stay around forever! Laurie

6925	113	7640	Tina from Helena, AL	2006-12-15 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Hi There. I ran across this website the other night as I was searching the internet in search of a natural approach to cure a sore throat that was so advanced that my tonsils were red and looked blistery and I could hardly swallow. It was very painful. I ran across the recommendation for the Cayenne pepper gargle but then saw that if I added ACV to this that I could drink it and it would cure my sinuses also which I have had a problem with for years and had a discharge of mucous every morning that was almost a reddish-brown color and tons of pressure in my head and had been taken Advil cold and sinus for it. I began drinking it yesterday morning and still did the Cayenne pepper and water gargle last night. My throat is already cleared up and I believe my sinuses are beginning but I am not sure what is happening with my sinuses. It seems to me like I am coughing up alot of stuff that has probably been there for while and I noticed that my mucous is now a light yellow color. My nose is also stuffy and I feel like I am literally coughing up stuff out of my chest that I didn't even know was there (lol). I am still drinking this little mixture today and will continue to as I believe that what is happening is that I am healing and that all of this that has been there is beginning to come out and I can tell because although my mucous is not clear yet and is very light yellowish, it is not brown/reddish which says something (lol). Despite all of this (The stuffy nose and coughing up mucous) I seem to feel great with a very high energy level and no pressure in the head causing it to ache. So I will let you know the final result and am very grateful for this remedy and this wonderful website and will be consulting it regularly for my health concerns and my clients.
6926	113	7641	Natalie from Carmel, IN	2006-08-14 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have a cold that started two days ago and was beginning to really suffer from sore throat and loss of voice. I made a tea of acv and cayenne pepper (non-organic grocery store kind) and sipped two mugs w/in 20 minutes last evening. By the time I went to bed, my throat no longer hurt and this morning I am able to speak more clearly. I know from experience that my colds last quite a long time and this wonderful tea has reduced my sick time. In fact, I didn't get to the "feel worse before you feel better" part! I will continue sipping throughout the day for good measure. Thanks for the great, healthy help!
6927	113	7642	Ani from Ontario, Canada	2006-07-06 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Well i'd been struggling with some form of tonsillitis for over a month. Viral (not strep since two swab tests came back negative, though only AFTER i had already taken an entire bottle of Penicillin!). It became so bad this week that i could hardly swallow. I'd never seen my tonsils so swollen, they were covered in white stuff and the doctor pointed out they were secreting puss - eeeuu! Well I made a tea using hot water, a couple spoons of apple cider vinegar and about 1/3 - 1/2 tspn of cayenne pepper. All symptoms are COMPLETELY gone after only 2 days of drinking this once or twice a day. REMARKABLE! I will drink this in a more diluted form on a daily basis as it gave me energy and makes me feel great in general
6928	113	7643	Ed from Ocoee, fl	2006-06-15 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	First time I have ever been to the Earth Clinic site, and as I had a terrible sore throat and the beginnings of the Flu, I thought I'd try anything. I tried gargling with ACV and Cayenne it took care of it immediately, could not believe anything would work that fast. The next day I woke up with the Flu. I tried the ACV drink and without taking anything else, the Flu was gone in two days. Truly amazing! I have told everyone about the site and my cure. Most impressive - Thanks
6929	113	7644	Diane from PA	2006-05-08 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I developed swollen lymph nodes inside my throat - right one was so swollen I could feel it through the outside of my neck and this all developed in 2 days. My doctor is on vacation and I remember hearing something about vinegar so I looked it up and wound up mixing straight apple cider vinegar (store brand) and McCormick Cayenne Pepper powder in a glass and gargled 3 times. The pain was significantly reduced for me and now I am having a hot cup of Irish Breakfast Tea with honey and lemon juice. I plan to keep going with the cayenne and vinegar.
6930	113	7645	Steve	2006-05-04 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	This hit me last Sunday, as I was exhausted, for no reason. Then I woke up Mon. with a slight sore throat, that got worse later in the day. Tues. it hit me like a freight train. I had a horrible sore throat that went all through my neck up to my ear. There wasn't a spot on me that didn't hurt to the touch. Every joint ached. My teeth even hurt. I started taking my wife's ACV on Tues.. Yesterday I put in a little red pepper. Last night I woke up in a cold, thick sweat. Today I feel 100% better with only a mild sore throat and no aches. I am still very weak though, I don't what this was, but I'm sure it was some type of flu. The guys at work gave me this and they went to the Dr. so I'll ask them. Thanks for the tips!!!
6931	113	7646	Kristin from Dallas, TX	2006-04-02 00:00:00	NAY	1	0	Sorry guys I tried the ACV and the Cayenne Pepper mixed together and diluted down with some water and had no success as of yet. Then, out of desperation, I did a straight shot of the AVC and rinsed with water, still no results. I'll keep trying and see how the day goes!
6932	113	7647	Lynn from Waterville, Maine	2007-08-15 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I learned about raspberry tea and started using a cup of warm raspberry tea with 1/2tsp of apple cider vinegar to gargle with and spit back out. I freaked when I saw the gunk it was nasty. If caught in time it gives a nice relief of a sore throat. From time to time I just gargle to keep from getting a build up of gunk. Especially during allergy seasons. I hope this helps as it did for me.
6933	113	7648	Paul from Melbourne, Australia	2009-07-11 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Yes the cayenne pepper works wonders. so does baking soda because of its alkalinity. (bacteria love an acidic environment) But I highly recommend putting a roll of toilet paper in the freezer for when you need it, and boy will you need it. I felt like i was giving birth to a marine distress flare on the toilet. Also something that is of "enormous" help. WARMTH. keep the neck area warm as possible with a large towel. and sleep with it on all night. you'll be amazed at what a difference it makes. White blood cells in your saliva love love loves warmth, and they are more active in a warm environment. SO WHAT WORKS FOR ME. First gargle apple cider to quickly remove the flem to expose the bacteria or virus, then hit it with baking soda. the baking soda makes the infected area alkaline. then hit it with the cayenne pepper. then wrap up the neck area with a towel and sleep with it on. If that doesn't work, I'll be dammed !
6934	113	7649	Jane from Grove City, OH, USA	2008-10-14 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Listerine. It cures your throat sores immediately, doesn't taste gross, and it makes your breath smell better. Use the amount you usually do for mouthwash rinsing, or if you haven't used it before use about one tablespoon. Gargle it as far back as you can without swallowing it. It really takes away the burn!
6935	113	7650	Betty from Broken Arrow, Ok	2012-11-23 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Had bad sore throat for several days and got low grade fever last night. Tried gargling with listerine, hydrogen peroxide... Neither worked. Have always loved EC site so decided to see what others used. Last night I made a mixture of 3T of ACV, 1T honey, and 1/4 cup water. Didn't have cayenne on hand. I gargled 3-4 times with mixture and then sipped the little that was left. It took a couple of hours, but the sore throat and fever left me. I slept well and am feeling good this morning. PTL!

I didn't want to take any medicines so I've been downing cough drops for the past three days which has done absolutely nothing! I logged on to find a home remedy, and of course being pregnant I have a jar of pickles in my fridge! After drinking in the hot pickles juice I already felt better!! Apparently, the heated vapors of vinger helped my congestion and soothed my sore throat instantly. My coughing subsided dramatically and my throat didn't hurt as much. Thanks!!!!
6939	114	7809	Kasey from Goshen, Utah	2007-04-21 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I know I am in desperate pain, when I'm sitting in front of the computer at three a.m. looking for home remedies for a super sore throat. I saw the doctor, well the nurse, today and was told after a sharp poke, instead of a swab of the throat that I do Not have strep. I almost wish I had it because two years ago, an anti-biotic took about two hours to kick in and End my suffering. So, the pick juice is really helping. I heated it, though I'm not sure that part is nessessary. I like pickle juice as is, but I've noticed relief just in breathing the vapors before it was cool enough to drink. I'll keep trying this and see if it "Cures" my sore throat. So far, it's absolutely helping the pain. So, thanks for the web site, and who ever listed this pickle idea. KJP Goshen Utah
6940	114	7810	Sister from Tucson, Arizona	2007-04-17 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I was suffering from discomfort in my throat all day and it worsened through tonight. I checked online for natural remedies (tried cinnamon on toast and it did not work) and came upon this site. I read about the dill pickle juice and, although unlike many of the others who seem to love pickles, I felt sick at the thought of trying this remedy. Even in the aisle at the store I felt disgusted. I opted for the kosher dill slices for the thinness (I probably should have selected the petite baby dills) and drank about an ounce of the juice followed by a sliced dill. My throat burned for some seconds after drinking the juice and eating the dill slice, but I am happy to say that the remedy worked and it worked FAST!
6941	114	7811	Lola from Bronx, New Jersey	2007-04-16 00:00:00	BETTER BUT NOT CURED	2	0	Pickle Juice helped my sore throat. I would not say this is a "cure", but it is a soother. It did make my throat feel slightly better, but not entirely. At this point even though I hate pickles, I was willing to try anything.
6942	114	7812	Eugene from Tucson, AZ	2007-03-23 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	The best way to use pickle juice ( dill is the best) is to heat it up like you would hot tea. The heat activates the dill and vinager in a way that it helps even more. This not only helps with sore throats, but for stuffy heads and chest as well. I have used it several times and has not let me down.

Today I was still feeling horrible and I could barely talk so I started looking for remedies and after my google search this was the first page I clicked on and when I saw pickle brine as a remedy i was amazed because I LOVE pickles so I drank some and TA-DAH!

After the cold had ran it's course I was still left with the lingering cough and irritating sore throat. Not to mention losing my voice on and off all week. I tried cough medicine from Robitussin to tylenol cough and cough (although the tylenol provided temporary pain relief; as soon it wore off the back came back)I also tried zytrec and sudafed (because i was told it might be allergies.) To my dismay nothing worked out. I got desperate and begun searching the web for a home remedy. And alas....(harps play here...) I found this site. When i saw pickle juice I figured this is a win-win situation. I love pickles... and i found it quite delightful to swig the juice. And i can say i'm never been more pleasantly surprised that it actually seems to work!! It was only about a hour ago that i drank it so i don't know if it's effects are going to last; but i've got my fingers crossed. Thank you so much for publishing this cure.

We were having her gargle with a salt rinse, with no real relief. We called my inlaws and they suggested rinsing with a tsp of bs in lukewarm water followed by the salt rinse every two hours. Amazing! My daughter's tonsils are a little less swollen and it took the pain away for her to sleep for a lot longer last night. I found your site this morning when I was researching bs rinses.

Mix: Place bicarb and salt into mug. Add apx two tablespoons of boiling hot water (a quater a cup). The temperature actiates the bicarb and salt and it bubbles furiously for a few seconds. Add cool water until temperature is warm/hot cool enough to gargle -and gargle it until all gone. The bicarb helps break down the mucous and permits the salt to do its job

I have been ready about the Cayenne Pepper for a sore throat. I can't even imagine how that must feel. I am not a fan of spicy hot things so I know I would never try the Cayenne Pepper. If there is anyone out there that is not a fan of this type of remedy, I have one that I have used for years with total success. Gargle with salt water. I can't give you the exact measurements, because I don't make the same amount every time, but I can tell you that the solution should not be any saltier than your tears which is not all the salty. This remedy has worked every time for me and my family. My husband's aunt, who was an army nurse during WWII, told me that they used salt and sugar solutions to cure a lot of things years ago when she was growing up. Both items have healing properties when used correctly. Hope this suggestion helps someone.

At that time every time I stood up I would get very dizzy and everything would turn black for 2 or 3 seconds. It it hurt when I swallowed, the pain came from the right side of my throat. I've looked up the information I was going to maybe buy some Cayenne Pepper but later on, I stopped talking for at least 6 hours STRAIGHT. It helped a lot, although this information may not help for some other people with worse sore throat. Although, I did eat and drink. All I didn't do was not to talk just kept my mind busy on something else.

The first time I had a sore throat I did what he said, 20 drops on my tongue and swallow. I did this a few times a day. You do get used to it, and it isn't hot after a while. Well, this being my first sore throat I noticed that I was still sick and so went to the Dr. The Dr. said, "This must be the worse sore throat you have ever had. " I said, "No, I didn't know I still had one. I just came in because I am sick. " He then said, "You have strep throat," and put me on antibiotics. Since then I learned to go to the Dr. If I am not getting well. I also carry Tabasco Sauce in my purse, probably the only one that does. If I start coughing in public due to a tickle or allergy or whatever, I use it, and then I am okay.

I was happy to see Tabasco on the list because I simply don't have cayenne peppers laying around the house. I used diluted Tabasco for gargling, but the real magic came afterwards when I took 2 straight shots of Tabasco afterwards. Please do not try this if you are not confident you can, I practically eat Tabasco a couple times a week. Not only did it help my sore throat, but it got my nasal congestion running. Thanks for the remedy!

My sore throat had been getting worse then today I had my husband pick me up some ginger root and honey so I could sip the tea all day. It's really been helping!
6976	115	7846	Kristen from Lincoln, NE	2009-01-03 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I had the worst sore throat of my life, so bad it was waking me up at night to take more advil. At 2:00 this morning I googled sore throat cure and found the cayenne pepper cure, I was skeptical but thought what do I have to lose. I put 5 to 6 shakes of tabasco sauce in hot water and gargled it over about 5 minutes. My lips were on fire from spitting it out. I also put some in orange juice as was described by someone else and swallowed it to get lower in my throat. I then went to sleep and 5 hours later my sore throat pain had gone from a 10 to a 2. I gargled again first thing the morning and now I don't have a sore throat! (at least not that I could complain about) It was amazing! I would tell anyone to give it a try! It worked for me and I already had it on hand at 2am.
6977	115	7847	Jacob from Birmingham, AL, USA	2008-12-03 00:00:00	WARNING!	6	0	I tried about 10 drops of tabasco in warm water for my terrible sore throat. Not a high concentration, but I figured it was a start. Well, my gargling technique may not be completely up to snuff. I think I let the liquid get too far down "the wrong tube," as it were. It triggered a reaction that closed up my airway and left me unable to breathe for about ten seconds, then gasping and barely able to breathe for thirty seconds after that.

The only thing I have found to work and work well is hydrogen peroxide. Thank you everyone for this useful and very much painless and no longer existing sore throat. :)
6981	116	7851	K Brown from Greenfield, In	2011-02-26 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Trust these posts... This really works! Just go to the drugstore and buy the brown bottle of Hydrogen Peroxide and gargle with it full strength... DO NOT SWALLOW. Rinse several times with plain tap water. NOT FOR CHILDREN since they could possibly swallow the peroxide. Note: The directions on the Hydrogen Peroxide bottle says it may be used as an oral rinse.
6982	116	7852	Dawn from Atlanta, Ga	2011-02-10 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I woke up 3 mornings gargling a sore throat. It was majorly sore, but I didn't want it to get any sorer. It was only sore on the right side. So, I came to my faithful and trusted site. I couldn't wait to try the peroxide in my ears. I poured a couple drops in the cap and drop it in my ear and went to bed. It did feel a little weird, but not painful at all. The next morning I got up and my throat wasn't sore AT ALL. It's been over a week now and I never got a cold. I shared this remedy with a cousin who was getting over a cold, but it was still lingering. She emailed me today and said "it worked like a charm"!!!! Thanks to EC and all of you for sharing and keeping us healthy!!
6983	116	7853	Chrissy from Akron, Ohio	2010-01-29 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have had a sore throat for a week now. I put the 3% Hydrogen Peroxide (no mix)onto some Qtips and then rubbed it onto my tonsils. It completely got rid of the white pus sacs on my tonsils and was foaming. The Qtips actually had pus all over them..Kinda gross but it worked!! I IMMEDIATELY felt better and am able to swallow now without pain..What a miracle that stuff is! I would rate the pain before using the peroxide, a 10, after using it a 1. Slight discomfort but not really noticeable. I also did it until I saw no more pus on my tonsil or on the qtips. Use a clean qtip each time. Also, this can cause you to gag..so be careful with that. Thanks so much for this website!
6984	116	7854	Shaeness  from Denver, CO	2009-06-14 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have been in terrible sore throat pain for 4 days now. Been to the the Doctors 2xs and was negative to strep. The size of my tonsils measure to golf balls and the are now covered with white pus! This afternoon my mother suggested that I try her old wives tale of gargling with peroxide! I poured a small amount into a cup, approx the amount that would be used to gargle with and instantly It foamed, i began to gag as huge amounts of mucus and began to pour out! I then rinsed with water a few times. As the afternoon has passes I still continue to have to spit out mucus but it seems to be doing the trick.

I am on an antibiotic for sinus infection, but I have NEVER had such a sore throat. My DR. recommended throat spray which works for about 2 mins... ibubrofen, nope, cough drops, nope. I just found this remedy and actually have it in the house. I felt instantly better, still hurts but I will continue to gargle with it. It even says it on the bottle for oral rinse.
6987	116	7857	Leslie from Jamestown, NC	2008-10-07 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Hydrogen Peroxide worked great for my sore throat. I gargled a mixture of half mouthwash, half hydrogen peroxide. This definitely cut the icky taste of the peroxide. It didn't give immediate relief, but my sore throat was cured overnight. I will definitely be using this again!
6988	116	7858	Martha Martinez from El Centro, CA	2008-10-05 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	The best way to completely heal a sore throat quick is with Hydrogen Peroxide. The regular brand from any store in the brown bottle. Just brush teeth and mouth and as far back throat as comfortably possible, then gargle about a capful or one tablespoon or even dilute it with a bit of water.

Just gargle it a few times and it will instantly stop the burning and scratching in your throat. Hope this works for you as much as it worked for me:)
6991	116	7861	Matthew from Wellton, Arizona	2008-08-21 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I recently tried the Hydrogen Peroxide gargle to cure my soar throat. Although there is a bad taste, it is effective. Just make sure you do it a couple of times until the pain is gone. It takes only minutes if you use pure peroxide, but if you can't stand the taste mix half water, half peroxide, it will take longer but it will work just as well.
7103	120	7960	Smita from Longmont, CO	2006-01-13 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	This works best for me even for coughs . Fresh ginger juice and honey. Mix 1 teaspoon of fresh ginger juice with 3 teaspoons of honey (to get ginger juice, grate a piece of ginger and squeeze it.) Take 1 teaspoon of this mix 3-4 times a day
6992	116	7862	Hazel from Lake Havasu City, Arizona	2008-03-23 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	The best remedy I have found for a sore throat is to gargle with hydrogen peroxide. If you can't stand it full strength, then mix with a half cup of warm water. You can gargle with a mouthwash afterwards if you don't like the taste. I used to have throat problems all the time, now all I do when I feel the least bit of discomfort is gargle with the hydrogen peroxide. Relief in only minutes. Cured in a day or two depending on the severity of the problem.
6993	116	7863	Marie from Baton Rouge, LA	2007-09-19 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have gargled hydrogen peroxide for sore throats/laryngitis for years. I get sinus congestion that ends up wrapped around my vocal cords. As soon as I start to lose my voice, I gargle with hydrogen peroxide. The bubbling breaks up the crud immediately which I'm able to cough up.
6994	116	7864	Nathan from Auburn, MA	2007-01-04 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	If you feel a sore throat coming gargle with hydrogen peroxide. I know it sounds crazy but it works. It's ok to swallow just a little bit but don't drink it. Do this a couple times about 5 minutes apart and wait about an hour and it will start to go away. I've been doing this for years and shared it with other people and they are amazed how well it works!
6995	116	7865	Robert from Orlando, FL	2006-11-15 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Gargle with peroxide first, then take a low dosage CHEWABLE vitamin C tablet (100 mg or 250 mg) place on tongue and leave it there until it dissolves. Don't swallow the tablet. It kept the scratchy throat from turning into a sore throat as well as an illness from coming on full blown. This works if it's caught in time, which is when one first detects a scratchy throat. I believe what it does is send vitamin c directly to the throat area killing the beginnings of an infection at its earliest stages. Another thing that can be done is to take some colloidal silver and put a drop in each nostril, especially after sneezing. The problem with it is that it's hard to verify that it actually DID stop a cold or flu since one can't prove what didn't happen. But it does work on a reliable basis.
6996	116	7866	Nancy from New Jersey	2006-11-12 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Just gargle with half strength peroxide, that's half peroxide and half water, twice a day. (the foaming action is nasty but the effect is well worth the unpleasant taste.) A sore throat will disappear within two days. You can add a salt water gargle between the peroxide gargles to be well even faster. (Peroxide will not treat strep. If the symptoms do not improve or if a high fever is present, please see your doctor.)

I have bad sinuse drainage which can really irrtate my throat which can lead to an infection. I can wake up with needles in my throat. Chop up the ice and suck on pieces in the back of your mouth. I don't have an ice crusher so I put cubes in a clean dish towel and whack them with a hammer. This always works. Sometimes with only one treatment.
7000	116	7870	Steve from Emmett, Idaho	2005-11-23 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have a couple family favorites to share. #1. Icy Hot rubbed "sparingly" on the full length of the front of your neck then wrap a hand towel around your neck and pin it with a safty pin so it stays in place. Go to bed and the next morning your sore throat is usually gone. You may want to do a test spot on your neck to see how sensitive your skin is to the Icy Hot. It will warm up your neck and possibly be uncomfortable for 5 to 10 minutes then it calms down and feels soothing. #2 The other remedies we have used successfully to fight a sore throat are gargling with Colloidal Silver or Grapefruit Extract. These are two of the strongest and safest (non-toxic) natural antibiotics available. To your health!

Waking up with a sore throat I would generally have tried an OTC remedy. I decided to gargle a few drops of iodine in a teaspoon of filtered water. I thank God it worked within 30 minutes to alleviate my pain. VOILA!

7004	117	7840	Ann-Taylor from Private, Caliornia	2009-01-12 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I've had a sore throat for at least 2 or 3 days. At that time every time I stood up I would get very dizzy and everything would turn black for 2 or 3 seconds. It it hurt when I swallowed, the pain came from the right side of my throat. I've looked up the information I was going to maybe buy some Cayenne Pepper but later on, I stopped talking for at least 6 hours STRAIGHT. It helped a lot, although this information may not help for some other people with worse sore throat. Although, I did eat and drink. All I didn't do was not to talk just kept my mind busy on something else.

Slice up some fresh ginger root and boil it in a few cups of water, along with some fresh garlic, lemon, cayenne pepper and honey. Let the mixture cool a bit, then strain and enjoy. Another variation is to use oranges and cranberries, as opposed to the lemon.

I did what another post advised and slid the teaspoon to the back of my tongue and tipped it down, swallowing. It was a bit rough because of the scratchy throat, but I was already in pain anyway (this was a better type of pain for me). I had tried high doses of naproxen, ibuprofen, tylenol, and aspirin, throat drops too. Nothing worked. In a few minutes after taking the Tobasco I could speak without making a horrible face (it hurt to talk). I had also been up 2 nights in a row because it hurt to swallow. I was able to finally get some sleep. It works!
7014	117	7874	Gene from Gatineau, QC, Canada	2008-04-29 00:00:00	WARNING!	6	0	Please post this question on the site. Hi, Having been stuck with a bad flu and an especially sore throat for a few days, I Googled and found this site, read every single post in the thread and decided I should try Tabasco Sauce, which is basically Cayenne but in a liquid form. At dinner last night, I sprinkled a generous amount of the sauce on my steak (20-25 drops) and even though I felt like dipping my tongue in ice water, I could feel my sinuses clearing up and the tenderness in my throat fading away. Mind you, every time I eat spicy food (on very rare occasions), I break out in a sweat and can feel a rush, like my blood is rushing through my body at accelerated speed. An hour after dinner, I sprinkled about 15 drops of Tabasco sauce in a glass of hot water and gargled with it, swallowing a bit at each gargle. A short while after my spicy dinner the gargling session, I experienced a severe panic attack which subsided in about an hour. Capsaicin provokes a rush of endorphins, thus counterbalancing the effect of the Clonazepam (explained below) which I take for chronic Panic Disorder and Epilepsy. "CLONAZEPAM which is a benzodiazepine. Benzodiazepines belong to a group of medicines that slow down the central nervous system. Clonazepam is effective in treating certain types of seizures (convulsions, Petit Mal) and is also used for a mental health condition called Panic Disorder by working on the nerve cells in the brain to enhance the effects of a chemical called gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA). GABA slows down nerve cell activity to cause relaxation and decrease nerve excitement." Later on: "Capsaicin helps prevent and heals stomach ulcers and has anti-inflammatory properties" Contrary to the above, I had severe heartburn in the middle of the night. "Cayenne is safe if used in moderation but can cause problems in people with stomach problems and ulcers." Something I read elsewhere which confirms what I experienced last night and is contradictory to the above quoted statement. "Some practitioners recommend mixing a small amount (starting with one sixteenth of a teaspoon, and working up to one teaspoon) of Cayenne powder in warm water to take 3 times a day. This is so the mouth experiences the hot spice and the stomach prepares itself. The mouth also absorbs much of the goodness itself, giving an immediate effect." In conclusion, I would like to try the experience again but I think I'll follow the above paragraph's advice, go easy at first and observe any reaction I might experience. Thoughts anyone? I don't really want to go to a clinic, wait 3 hours in a roomful of coughing people only to get a prescription for an antibiotic whose side effects are worse than the benefits.

I had not had it for long, less than a Day, but usually my sore Throats don't last until I wake up. So, not wanting to take any Pills, I looked up natural Cures for a sore Throat and was led to this Site. I decided to use the tabasco Sauce, since I knew that Item to be on Hand. Unfortunately, I didn't get the Teaspoon all the Way to beyond my Tongue, so some of my Mouth is in Pain from the Capsaicin, but my sore Throat is completely gone.

After ready some testimonials, I mixed up a solution of 1/2 teaspoon of tabasco with one cup of warm water. I gargled with it, while swollowing a small amount in the end of each round. After just 4 gargles and about 3 minutes my throat was soothed while the inflamation in my nasal passage cleared. The nasal congestion returned but was the severity was lessoned and I felt quite a bit better! Thanks to homeapothy....a bit of God's wisdom passed on through tradition and good people keeping it alive!

I woke up around 3 AM and couldn't go back to sleep because of my itchy and sore throat so I hopped on the web and found this place. I didn't have any cayenne so I just poured some Tobasco sauce straight into the back of my throat. It burned like crazy at first and I had to take a sip of water, but my throat immediately felt better. I followed that up by gargling some hot water mixed with a teaspoon full of Tobasco sauce. It relieved my throat long enough for me to fall back asleep.

Read through the posts and although I do have cayenne pepper in the pantry, it didn't sound too pleasant to gargle it and drink in a tea. So I tried a shot of tobasco sauce ( I wouldn't recomend this if you can't handle hot/spicy foods very well.) I followed the shot with a rather large glass of milk to sooth, and it's been 5 hours now and my throat feels so much better. It's still sore, but not razorblade painful. I think I'll try another shot tonight before bed and see how it goes.

I looked at all the remedies and didn't want to try Apple Cider Vinegar. I have been sipping Hot honey tea for days and have the worst razor cutting sore throat ever. It gets much worse when I wake up in the morning, so I just put four teaspoons of straight tabasco down the hatch and my throat is 55-65% better right now. Slide the spoon past your tongue so it goes right to the throat. I took 4 teaspoons full tabasco five minutes apart, then gargled with 1 tablespoon of cayenne, 1 teaspoon of tabasco, warm water and lemon juice-which also helped. I am not cured yet, but the pain is cut in half! Thank you all for posting on this site, thank God I found it because i DESPISE gargling with forsaken warm salt water-I hate salt!

No medicine would work for me..So as I said I tried Tabasco..Heres the thing I just took a little sip of it out of the bottle and I just HAD to take a drink of water and after I was done drinking I was like O MY GOD! My sore throat was all gone and my nostrils wernt clogged I felt like a new person! It even settles stomachs! I know it sounds weird u would think it would give you heart burn but it didnt. just a sip thought i'm not saying drink it! Anyways, Try it. It works like a charm!
7022	117	7882	Gina from Baltimore, Marland	2008-01-17 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I started getting a sore throat yesterday, and like i always do, i slept with a halls in my mouth. It got worse today and nothing soothed it. So I googled sore throat remedies and came to this site. I didn't have the honey, so I decided to do the tobasco. I poured tobasco on a hotdog (which just so happened to be hot wing flavor) and a little apple cider. The first bite was hell in my mouth. It burned back in my ears. I have completed the hot dog, my nose is incredibly runny, my mouth is on fire, but my sore throat feels better- maybe I burned off all the nerves!

7024	117	7884	Alyssa from Cranston, Rhode Island	2008-01-01 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I've been sick for about three days. I try to avoid medications and doctors visits because I don't really have the money to spare, and I'm not a fan of over the counter medicines like DayQuil (nature never intended anything to be that orange!) Today is my last day of vacation before I have to return to school, sad story, I know. And my boyfriend is home from college so I want to see him, only natural. But the last thing I want to do is get him sick, or feel crappy while I'm with him. I usually just wait out a sickness, let my body fight it off. I don't have time to waste in bed any more though. So I came to Earth Clinic and read about the Cayenne Pepper but I don't have any of that. Then I read about TABASCO! Funny thing was while I was sifting through the medicine cabinet I looked at the bottle and though "I bet that would clear my sinuses" but I didn't want to irritate my throat. So I mixed it with hot water, lemon juice, and honey. It's sweet with a nice spicey kick I love it and in five minutes I can breath out of one side of my nose and my throat doesn't hurt anymore! I really hope that this helps long term as well but if you need instant relief, try this!
7025	117	7885	Teigs from Qld, Australia	2007-12-07 00:00:00	BETTER BUT NOT CURED	2	0	i don't have any of that Cayenne stuff but i did have the tobasco because i like hot things. anyway last night i was going to bed and i could feel a cold coming on. i had some medicine and i went to bed hoping that by morning it would be gone. three friends are coming over for a christmas party and i have done everything to get it. then finally mum and dad said yes. and then i came down with this. i woke up this morning and it had only gotten worse and i had a stuffy nose. i hated to swallow. i got up and typed in home remedies for a sore throat into google and it came up with this site. i had never heard of Cayenne and it took me a few stories to realise what it was. and then i got the tobasco sauce and added drops to my already made honey, lemon hot water and i sipped it and then gargled it and sipped it again. it is very tasty. my friends are coming at 2pm and it is now 8:01am so i hope it cures fast. p.s if anyone has any faster moving remedies please tell us.
7026	117	7886	Matt from Buena Park, California	2007-11-02 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	So its the second day of my sore throat, 7:25am Friday, needless to say I did not get much sleep last night. I'm desprate to try anything, don't have cayenne, but I do have tobasco! As I'm reading and writting I'm enjoying a hot bowl of chicken noodle soup with....tabasco. It dosent get rid of the itchy throat and it burns a little going down, but as they say, no pain, no gain. I'm happy to report an immidiate mild change in my sore throat and am looking forward for even greater results as the day progesses.

It was easier to just drink it slowly, mixed with a little water, and coat my soar throat on the way down. I think my sore throat is much better now.

It won't cure the sore throat. but it will cause it to not hurt. It will also take away the tickle in one's throat. when an allergy attacks. It is a teaspoon of Tabasco Sauce, taken maybe 3 to 4 times a day. Most people can't handle it, and so you would have to built up the dosage, but I had a chiropractor recommend it to me, and I have never suffered the pain of a sore throat since, not even when I had strep throat.
7029	117	7889	Dana from Fort Worth, Texas	2007-12-05 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have had a sore throat twice in the last two weeks, probably due to allergies, and both times I have COMPLETELY kicked it by gargling with tea tree oil mouthwash (I found it at a health food store). I would use it maybe 3 or 4 times during the day whenever it started hurting again, but w/each use it hurt less and then was all gone! Gasp! It had felt swollen as well and that also went away... it just seemed to kill whatever was causing it. I didn't even gargle that long, since it has a sort of medicinal, monkey urine flavor --but don't be scared. Hope this helps somebody!

I am on antibiotics at the moment (I had to take them, my family insisted) but I developed a couple of days ago a sore throat. I was worried it was antibiotic resistant strep, since I have been having strep other times this year. I followed Ted advise: I gargled with potassium bicarbonate (my brother got it in Italy) and the sore throat disappeared magically in half a day! That's impressive! Thanks to Ted! He is the best!
7035	117	7895	Jacob from Costa Mesa, Ca	2008-10-26 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have very sensitive sinuses. I cannot, in my entire life, recall a year where I did not get to enjoy the wonders of a sinus infection. For me this means, among other things, lots and lots of very sore throats. A few years ago I was informed of an unorthodox sounding homeopathic remedy which I tried and have had tremendous success with. What strikes me as odd is that this remedy is not at all featured on your sore throat article as a popular solution. At the time I was working in a bar as a bouncer and between the yelling that is necessary to control a crowd and the sore throat I had even breathing had become a labored process. I asked the bartender what she did in these situations. She told me that she drank a shot of tequila and had learned to do so from one of our cooks, Luciano (Lucy for short.) I thought she was messing with me and didnt appreciate it. So I approached Lucy when she wasnt around and asked him. He told me about the tequila. He is a notorious joker, so I still didn't believe. I asked our other cook Pedro, and he also told me he would take a shot of tequila. It was just too much, so I figured I'd do it just to prove them wrong. I know that you prefer to keep your website label free, but they were pretty insistant that I use Patron, and I will explain why in a moment. Patron is very pungent, but the silver label is incredibly smooth as tequila goes, and that is pretty much the only reason to use it above other tequilas. I have used Cuervo as a cheap alternative and had similar success, the Patron is just more pleasant going down. As a rule drinking is a bad idea with a sore throat because it will dehydrate you and aggravate the condition and further your discomfort. If you can keep it to just ONE shot though the results are amazing. That night, and every time I have had a sore throat worth treating since then, the shot of tequila worked miracles. Relief within about a minute, and by the next morning my throat felt good enough to let me yell again. I took another shot the following night and it was all cleared up by the next day. I get predictably similar results every time I repeat this remedy. I must stress that keeping yourself to just 1 or 2 shots is PARAMOUNT. A sore throat is not a good reason to go out and have a night of binge drinking. You will regret it.
7036	117	7896	Ninorine from Tampa, Florida	2007-09-21 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	An old family remedy that has been in my family for years is to boil four tomatoes with a teaspoon of salt until cooked then mash them up to form a paste. Then apply this paste to your neck area and quickly rap your neck around with warm moist towels, then lay down for thirty minutes. If you have a vaporizer place it near your head. This should clear your sore throat in about two day. The remaining juice from the tomatoe paste can be used as a soothing throat drink mixture, be sure to add a hint of salt. It works like a charm. Most say it works best on children.

To alleviate the soreness, I put approximately 1/4 teaspoon of turmeric in my mouth and held it there until it was thoroughly mixed with saliva then slowly swallowed the mixture aided with a little liquid of choice such as water or coffee,etc..A very similar technique to oil pulling except there was only turmeric and saliva-no oil was used.WHAT A RELIEF!!!The turmeric will slightly numb the tongue but this passes quickly. I do not spray the H202 into the nose as it tends to decrease my sense of taste.

But it returned soon after. Then I cut up half a clove of garlic and added a teaspoon of honey to it. I was unable to take the garlic due to its burning taste. But the honey coated the 'scratchy and painful' parts of my throat. The skin has gone off at the back of my throat. So it is still painful..!

I recently found your website in some research I am doing on Cayenne and Lymph, but was a little disconcerted to see that you published someone's testimonial warning others not to use cayenne if they do not want their blood thinned.
7043	118	7903	Amy from New Haven, CT	2007-02-18 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Love your site but wanted to let you know that the reason you are supposed to stop taking cayenne pepper before surgery has nothing whatsoever to do with inflammation (which in most cases it doesn't cause anyhow). The reason is that Cayenne Pepper is a very effective blood thinner and so, like aspirin, you don't take it prior to surgery, to ensure minimal blood loss.

I too was worried about teh cayenne buring my mouth, since this had happened to me years before, but it did nto happen this time. (Perhaps the salt neutralized it?) Anyhow, aftert the first 2-3 gargles I saw about 50% improvement in the pain. This convinced me to continue and now I have some hpe I will banish this miserable sore throat before I must return to work (tomorrow! )

Boil 1.5 cups water add fresh grated ginger (I used about 3 Tablespoons) add fresh garlic (2-3 cloves chopped) add cayenne (to taste, I use a lot) add turmeric add fresh lemon (whole, then throw peal in there) add about 1 tablespoon honey or agave. This is a great detoxifier and a sore throat cure!

When I got home I boiled 4 cloves of garlic (crushed), 6 teaspoons of cayenne powder, and a tablespoon of peeled, sliced ginger. I let it cool, and because it was such a hot concoction, I put it in my blender with one cucumber, 4 teaspoons of cinnamon powder and a stick of celery. Also half a carrot for taste. Added an additional 1/2 cup of water, blended it and drank. Within 2 hrs, my sore throat was 95% gone. A 2nd dose will definitely get rid of the sore throat 100%.

7048	118	7908	India from Coral Springs, Florida	2008-08-24 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I used the idea of Jess J of Boca Raton, Florida, only I upped the dose of cayenne pepper to 1/2 a teaspoon. 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper 2 tablespoons of honey 12-16 ounces of hot water And a teabag of your choice for flavor. I barely took a sip because I thought it would burn or taste terrible, but it really didn't! It was a subtle spicy and it tingled and felt really good. I barely took a sip, and already I could feel my voice coming back (I had a horrible sore throat, in which it hurt to swallow etc) It didn't immediately cure the hurting to swallow, but I've still got a whole cup to go. I think it'll help. Thanks Earth Clinic and everyone for posting these remedies!

7052	118	7912	Laura from Pittsburgh, PA	2008-02-05 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I tried James' remedy tea first. Let me say, I HATE vinegar, and it was god awful to swallow down. I took about 4 sips, gargling first, then swallowing. My throat has gone from razorblades to feeling just swollen, but thankfully, ABLE TO SWALLOW! I'm not suprised it worked, based on all the reviews. I will suggest that you follow what another post said and mix equal parts honey to apple cider vinegar if you can't stand the taste of vinegar. I don't mind the cayenne, so I still mixed about an 1/8 teaspoon with 2 TBS honey and 2 TBS ACV. I added a bit of hot water (like 1/4 cup) and a dash of lemon juice. I gargled and swallowed this. I think I will continue to do the "shots" as opposed to the tea. BUT IT DOES WORK! I managed to eat a nice chocolate donut (ah comfort food) within 10 minutes. AWESOME!!! I will continue every two hours throughout the day with the shots. I imagine adding some ginger may help, as well.

I read about cayenne pepper and decided to use it. I was really skeptical. What I did was made tea with water, ginger root, lemon and honey and then added 1/8th teaspoon to my tea. It burned alot in my throat. However 20 minutes later my pain was gone. It really numbed my throat and I was able to swallow, drink and eat without a problem. Cayenne pepper anesthetizes the pain. I am a true believer of cayenne pepper. I now have used it in my homemade chicken soup. Every time I use it I feel relief. So awesome!

Tried ACV first, and got some relief, but only about an hour's worth. I read all of the posts on cayenne and decided that one was next, but did not have any of the pepper. I remembered that it is in hot sauce, so i mixed up a tea. I boiled some water, and then added a shake or two of ground ginger, a tablespoon of hot sauce, a tsp of oregano, a tablespoon of honey, tablespoon of lemon juice and a green tea teabag. I let it steep for about 5 minutes. What i had was a concoction... "liquid fire" and about 30 minutes after drinking, no sore throat and nasal passages were draining. The next morning i was surprised to still be clear. Thanks for posting this idea.

Just started getting a horrible sore throat about 3 hours ago and I HATE getting sick, especially right before the holidays. I decided to pull out the heavy guns and made a hot tea of about 1/4 tsp. ground cayenne, three shots of Tabasco, 3 tbspns maple syrup, and 1 tbspn champagne vinegar (I didn't have any ACV). As I sit here typing I am sipping this spicy brew and the left side of my throat is no longer hurting. The right side is still tender but I think it is getting better. I also have clear sinus passages and I am coughing up lots of clear sticky phlegm. I intend to keep drinking this stuff until I am better. I really think it is working. ---NEW CAYENNE FAN
7058	118	7918	Trish from Kansas City, MO	2007-12-11 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Hi, I wanted to quickly comment on some of the 'nay' responses to the cayenne pepper remedy. For those of you who are burning the living you-know-what out of your mouths, try lessening the amount of pepper taken in one dose and take it more often. A few people have mentioned taking lemon juice, maple syrup, and the pepper with water. This is actually a fasting recipe as well (the fast Beyonce was one to lose weight for 'Dream Girls'). The proper measurements are 10oz. distilled water, 2 tablespoons FRESH lemon juice, 2 T. maple syrup (Grade B, and organic is best if you can afford it), and a PINCH of cayenne pepper(about 1/8 teaspoon or even less). The water should be heated before mixing in the ingredients. Try drinking this mixture throughout the day. It takes time but the soreness in your throat will eventually subside. It you drink it throughout the day and eat nothing, you will also start to detox your body and lose some water weight overnight as well, given you have no major health problems. Also, another trick (if you throat has just started hurting)...try mixing 6 to 8 drops of hydrogen peroxide in a large glass of distilled/purified (not spring) water and drinking several times throughout the day. Usually my sore throats start to feel relief with in 15 minutes to half an hour after the first glass. If it's pesky, keep drinking. If you have something bad already, like strep, you may need to just go to the doctor. It may be too late for the peroxide to relieve pain, but it may lessen the the time you are sick. Try an alternative healer, for those of you not wanting to take drugs (and I don't blame you). Also, someone commented, saying that antibiotics was the only cure. Be careful, if you choose to take antibiotics make sure you take a good round of probiotics, for a month at least, afterward. Otherwise you are just killing off the good guys in your gut and setting yourself up for future problems.

I did this when I drank my coffee this morning and it is a God-Send ! Just sprinkle some cayenne pepper in your coffee and drink it! It makes the flavor of the coffee WONDERFUL and it is fantastic for your throat! This website is a pure blessing from God. Thank you to all who come here and share their experiences!
7060	118	7920	Sabrina from Canada	2007-05-04 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	An oldie but a goodie, my recipe is a little different. Mix vinegar of any variety with a spoonful of cayenne, a spoonful of licorice root, and a small amount of RAW honey. Drink it back - the sore throat will go away shortly. The raw honey is great because honey has natural antiseptic properties, and it makes the mix a little easier to drink!
7061	118	7921	Janeene from Saginaw, MI	2006-12-28 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have used this remedy for YEARS and can tell you, IT WORKS!! The only thing that I do different is, I add an equal amount of ground ginger along with the cayenne pepper into a cup of HOT water and allow it to steep with a lid on the cup for 5 minutes. Then allow it to cool to a comfortable temperature (or add a little cold water) and gargle. This may seem time consuming when you are in a lot of pain but it is worth the wait! Allowing it to steep like that makes sure the spices are at their best. The cayenne brings the blood to the throat helping circulation for those well needed "healing soldiers" and the ginger calms the throat and helps reduce the swelling. I sometimes drink this as a tea on those cold winter nights to help me stay warm! For you hunters out there...sprinkle cayenne in your socks to keep your feet warm out in the field. The moisture from your feet activates the heat of the pepper keeping those toes TOASTY!!! CAYENNE PEPPER IS THE BEST!

Still here this morning. Went online and found the mixture of 1/2 tsp of each: cayenne, salt, lemon juice in 1/2 cup of water. WOW. First gargle took the sore throat away! Will repeat today until this evening. I did swallow the second gargle and tolerated it well.
7063	118	7923	Carl from Hoquiam, Wa	2012-06-06 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Barely been able to eat for 2 days. Swallowing is torture, I wince everytime. I mixed 1tsp cayenne, 1tsp salt, 1tsp lemon in a cup of water. Gargled for a couple of minutes, then I spit out the concoction but swallowed what was left in my mouth. Took a couple of minutes but it feels literally 100% better. Thanx ya'll

7065	118	7925	Essma from Dallas, TX	2009-03-13 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	My in laws are from Pakistan; many of their home remedies are similar to those in Ayurveda, and my mother in law's suggestions are unbelievably effective for the kids' ailments. So to soothe a sore throat (not a cure but will help you sleep and function), keep a clove or a few cloves (the spice) in the back of your mouth. You can bite it a few times to release the oils. Cloves have numbing properties so maybe that is how it works. Anyway, everyone i have shared this with has found relief for their sore throats/night coughs with this!
7066	118	7926	Avidcooker from Raleigh, NC	2007-12-23 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Yes, I am a true believer of holistic medicine and cloves definately work great for sore throats. When I feel the sore throat coming on, I suck on 2 cloves, biting on them just a little so that the oil form within gets released. I keep it in my mouth for q hour or so, 3 times a day. And the sore throat is gone within 12 hours. I've never had to go to a doctor for this condition even as a child... the cure is there right at home.

I was searching for a remedy for sore throat and tried cloves. After sucking/chewing 4-5 cloves in a day, my throat felt MUCH better and the next day it was totally gone!! I was so GRATEFUL dat I didnt need antibiotics 4 it!
7068	118	7928	Donny from Miami, FL	2007-05-31 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I rarely get sick. I am in pretty good shape, don't always exercise like I should, but I don't allow myself to get out of shape. However, every now and then I do catch something. Caught a sore throat the other day and instead of buying medicine from the store, I decided to go natural on the problem. I'm drinking only citrus juices (grapefruit is my preference), water, and tea with lemon and honey. For on the go relief I may take an aspirin (no more than 3 in 24 hours), and I take a couple whole cloves (not garlic, the spice), nibble on them a bit, and hold them between my teeth/cheeks and just suck on them. A little bitter, but instantly numbs the sore throat, and on the plus side, keeps your breath fresh and smelling like cinnamon! Excellent strategy, and I WILL use it in the future.

I've had a sore throat for 4 days now and I tried it in desperation, but nothing happened. I have a big presentation tomorrow and all I have to show for my herbal remedy to cure my excurciatingly sore throat are yellow neck and wrists! Maybe I did it wrong, but gargling 1 tsp of the Apple Cider Vinegar in a glass of warm water worked better for me!!

After having tried the egg whites for her fever and it working I came back to this site and sure enough - a remedy for a sore throat...IODINE! I put some on her wrists and on the sides of her throat. It took a little bit - like hours, but her sore throat went away and has not returned since! It has been almost a week now! Thanks again for the wonderful remedies!!

Wherever you normally sit - say, a couch or favorite easy chair - place towels where your wrists and hands would normally rest. This is especially important if, like me, you sweat profusely even when still. I also suggest wearing clothing that you won't mind possibly getting stained, as the iodine WILL get all over.

After 2 horrible nights of restless sleep. i found this website in searching for a cure (non-prescription) Iodine was suggested. So about noon today, painted the wrists and throat areas. I found Iodine at a local drug store. It was under $2. I took a one hour nap and already felt better. The prior two days, it hurt to swallow, it was horrible to eat or drink, burning sensation during both. I ate watermelon and when i would drink i would drink as fast as possible. by 2 pm i was at a soup and salads (buffet restaurant) enjoying soup, more fruit, drinking. it pretty much took care of my sore throat and swollen glands. i read here that it takes care of skin tags. i placed iodine on the 3 i have and hopefully they will be gone. i will report back as to whether or not it works, but as far as the initial success and how great i feel, i have a positive outlook.

I thought she was crazy. But it worked! The pain was completely gone the next morning. Shortly thereafter my son became sick with a bad cold.

7082	120	7651	My2cents from Rock Hill, Sc, USA	2012-11-18 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	YEA! Garlic is one of my favorite remedies. I am currently battling a terrible sore throat. I tried the ACV/honey gargle and that rendered me an, extreme and severe worsening of the sore throat just minutes after. I had a terrible time during the night. Each time I swallowed I felt as though my throat was punishing me. Today I went back to my garlic tea. I grate the garlic as this brings the best benefit. The finer the chop/grate on garlic, the more helpful compounds will be released. I allow the garlic to sit for 15 minutes after grating. Then I boil my water. I use a cup of water per clove of garlic. I usually just do one cup at a time because I prefer it to be fresh. I pour the boiled water over the garlic which I grated into a thermos or coffee cup. I allow it to steep a while. Then I just sip it slowly. It may take an hour to finish the cup, but slower is better. The more times the throat gets "washed" in the garlic the better. So don't try to drink it too quickly. Each sip is a small "treatment". Since doing this today, I am now done with the severe pain I had when swallowing, and am back to having discomfort upon swallowing. I will do this tea twice more today. I think three times in a day should be sufficient.

I came across this site and tried the cayanne pepper and apple cider remedies. I have to say, both of them tasted terrible and only provided up to ten minutes of relief. I then came across a post about raw garlic, i was skeptic, but willing to try almost anything. I took two garlic cloves from my fridge and chopped them up into cylinders.

Usually when these sore throats come upon me, i'd rough it out drinking hot liquids for days until the soreness eventually cures. Well I decided that since this woke me up from sweet sweet slumber, i'd FIGHT BACK! So I googled "sore throat remedies" and found this site! How sweet it was! I searched through my spice cabinet and found no cayenne pepper, (which is sad, i'm going to buy a small bottle soon) I never have Apple Cider Vinegar on hand, so I decided to go straight for the garlic. I cut up one clove in small pieces, eating them slowly, and the effect is instantaneous! Gives you a nice burning feeling on your throat, and lasts quite a while too.

7091	120	7949	Chastity from Chicago	2006-09-14 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	This remedy cures a sore throat, cold, or stomach virus. This remedy was given to me by my mother in law. She is a very old Mexican women. She told me her Grandma taught it to her. Remember in Mexico they cant just call a doctor when they have a sore throat. You will need a lime/lemon a clove of garlic and two teaspoons of honey. chop the garlic into very small pieces and mix it with all the juice of 2 limes, and the honey. Take one teaspoon every 30 minutes. Your throat will be as good as new. You can also put it into your tea, or any other hot or cold drinks (add as much as you like.

7093	120	7951	Praky from St. John, Barbados	2009-12-13 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Personal Recipe: 1) 1-1/2 tablespoon (heaped) of freshly grated ginger (main ingredient) 2) 1 tablespoon (crude/pure) lime (or lemon) juice 3) 1 teaspoon honey 4) 2 cups boiling water Method: 1) Put 2 cups of clean water to boil 2) Peel/scrape ginger skin off, then finely grate ginger pieces until you get one-and-a-half tablespoonfuls 3) Squeeze the lime or lemon until you get 1 tablespoonful and put aside 4) Then place the grated ginger in a heat-proof cup and pour boiling water over it. Add lime juice and honey. Combine by pouring this mixture from one cup into another, over and over, until mixture gets ginger-coloured (Steeping). 5) Sip on/drink this hot mixture as much as you could safely bear, WITH the grated ginger pulp. Tip: Let grated ginger settle a bit in throat area while drinking Notes: 1)Check to see if you are allergic to any of the ingredients listed before atempting 2) Fresh ginger and lime are useful because the beneficial Enzymes are said to be more abundant than powder forms 3) Use this tea/mixture at least twice daily (morning/evening) for 3 days and you will notice the difference before the 3 days ..got this from a website who's owner went to India and was told of this tea there, after having horible sore throat. Take care

I keep some ginger in my purse and chew on pieces of it all through the day. It's not very pleasant as it burns (especially if you already have a sore throat) but it works like a miracle!

Just take so regular tea, and mix in lemon juice, some ginger, a dash of salt, a 2 or 3 teaspoons of pickle brine, cayenne pepper. I prefer on the side to have a cup of milk and/or water, to help with the taste and cut down on the taste. This is basically a mix of a lot of little cures I have tried. I got fed up with them and just started trying my own things, good luck.

Add these to a cup and pour boiling water over it. Let it steep, then drink. You really have to like ginger as it is super spicy hot.

7101	120	7958	Laura from Massachusetts	2006-02-06 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have to voice my opinion about the ginger tea with lemon! I found it to be very soothing, but I also find that I need to drink a lot of it. I will have the tea for about 2-3 days, 2-3 times a day. It does make me feel better, unless I've let my cold go for a few days without treatment, in that case, it will just soothe the symptoms while I am drinking it, but not relieve the cold completely. In those cases, I've normally had to take OTC meds, in conjunction. I also like zinc in lozenge form with lemon, or zicam (zinc in liquid gel form that is placed directly in the nasal passages), but you have to be careful with these as they can cause nausea if you take too much. Just follow the instructions on the package, it does work!

I use Grapefruit Seed Extract now - known for killing the strep virus (and I had strep 6 times in one year and hated taking antibiotics) ... so I was on a quest. Anyways, GSE turns out to be a Godsend, kills internal bugs without biotics... great thing! Brush teeth to kill sore throats - or gargle, if more severe. Great thing is, it numbs it. Raw throat, however, can't seem to snuff. What do you to when your 7 year old has a terrible raw throat and can't swallow? Darn!

Raw garlic- chewed without anything... of course i started to stuffing bread in my mouth- garlic numbed my tongue- and the numbness spread at the side of tongue, down to throat. Just after 2 garlic pieces i am able to swallow without pain (and 2 days on honey and lemon didn't help). I am going to continue with this treatment. .. although i am a bit worried what is my social life going to look like in the next couple days

She is a very old Mexican women. She told me her Grandma taught it to her. Remember in Mexico they cant just call a doctor when they have a sore throat. You will need a lime/lemon a clove of garlic and two teaspoons of honey. chop the garlic into very small pieces and mix it with all the juice of 2 limes, and the honey. Take one teaspoon every 30 minutes. Your throat will be as good as new. You can also put it into your tea, or any other hot or cold drinks (add as much as you like.

(best if you eat it with some bread) NOT only does it help the sore throat go away faster it also keeps your chest from getting filling up with mucus.

Both of us tried many remedies and since my girl is just 6 months old we did not know what to do. I tried after reading from the site cayenne- gargling, saltwater gargling, Tabasco sauce, etc. Finally, one thing worked for both of us!! I used Haritaki powder(available in almost all Indian stores). It is a very cheap powder($2.39 or so). It is very bitter powder. Biological name is called Terminalia chebulam (Black Myrobalan in English). Black Myrobalan powder is also available in some health stores but Indian stores offers best price. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haritaki

I was reading all the responses to your Cayenne cure for sore throats and I wanted to share a cure I learned also works well: you can chew a spoonful of honeycomb. Not just plain honey, but honey still packaged the way bees make it, with the beeswax. I read of this cure in an old book of folk remedies from Vermont (when I lived in Wisconsin). I didn't believe it but a while after reading it I began to catch a cold, with my throat all scratchy and aching so it hurt to swallow. I tried this remedy, and what do you know -- after a minute or so of chewing my throat was clear and pain-free. That nice effect lasted about half an hour, then the symptoms began to return -- so I tried a second time and that cleared it up for good. I was amazed how well it worked. I'm also happy to know a second remedy to try too, since it is not so easy to get honeycomb over here in Togo. Honey is also a great for healing burns and infections -- if you search online you'll find plenty of information.

When I'm in a situation where I can't gargle, I take a teaspoon of honey for instant relief for a sore throat. The effects generally last for several hours.

Living in the south we are more prone to allergy related problems and believe in grandmas remedies. My cure for sinus and sore throat problems is a spoonful of horseradish, coated with Lousianna Hot Sauce (made from cayenne pepper) and take it till you feel better. I usually eat about 3 heaping spoonfuls every hour till it is gone. Usually gone by the next day.

7130	122	7975	Isaac from Champaign, Il	2011-10-25 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	after 2 days of sore throat, I tried a Jack Daniels, honey and Lemon juice gargle, but it didn't really work well for me (probably because I couldn't stand it long enough to gargle) then tried mouthwash about an hour later and that didn't help at all. After coming to this site I tried hotsauce and lemon juice I meant to gargle but swallowed accidently. For about 30 seconds I was in the most god awful pain ever, then I hacked up a chunk of phlegm the size of a quarter that looked like it had a tiny bit of blood it it. I was worried, but I coughed up a smaller bit that didn't have any, and hadn't seen blood since, so I think it was just from violent coughing.

So, I've had strep throat for about 4 days now, and it is NOT getting better. I was looking online for anything that would help, and i came across the cayanne pepper trick. I ran upstairs to see if i had any, and to my dismay, i did not. what i did have though, was franks red hot sauce, containing, vinegar, water, and of coarse cayanne peppers. I just carry a bottle around, and drink one swig an hour. and honestly, i have no pain whatsoever, my throat feels fine. its not so much a cure, as much as its instant pain relief. its amazing. it legitimatly works better then any medicine ive ever seen. try it out if you dont believe me.

I sucked it up and took a glass of hot water with some generic hot sauce and a little honey. After just the first sip my sore throat that has been around for over 2 weeks was much lighter. I will continue to use til it is gone completely. Thank you so much!
7136	122	7981	Tamairo from Milwaukee, United States	2008-02-12 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I read through a wealth of information here. I was very skeptical about using tobasco sauce! It is just way too hot. However, I didn't have any in my kitchen anyway. If I did, I probably would have used it as bad as my throat was hurting. I ended up using a derivative of the tobasco sauce. I got the Louisiana Hot Sauce from my cupboard. I read the ingredients and Cayenne Pepper was in there. So I figured, what the hell! Most people on here have said that it works, I am in so much pain! I thought, well, my throat feels so bad, it can't do anything but get better from this. I took a small 4 ounce plastic cup. I put about six shakes of hot sauce, and the rest hot water. I gargled with this solution for about 5-6 gargles in a row. The first few times, my throat felt like it was on fire. I thought that the fire department would need to be called. I was looking for a fire extinguisher! Anyway, to my surprise, this remedy actually gave me alot of relief! I couldn't believe it! I am going to see how I feel in the morning. I was just about to go to the ER. I just decided to search the net first and found this site. Awesome guys! Thanks for your helpful suggestions! I feel alot better.

You should avoid eating dairy products as much as possible while fighting a cold because they cause your body to secrete more mucous and phlegm--which means that you'll actually be making your congestion worse.

It ads to the beneficial effects of the hotness the other beneficial effects of salt exposure. I don't have any cayenne or Tabasco on hand (and the weather is not such that I can easily get out and get them right now), but I have Sriracha, which is a hot pepper/garlic sauce I got from a local Oriental food market. I mixed a teaspoon or so of it with the beef bouillon (didn't really measure, just squirted a glob in that looked about that size), and it worked well.
7139	122	7984	Brandon from Pasadena, Maryland	2008-02-06 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Hello, today I got a bad sore throat and found this site. I'm only 15 so I don't have a lot of this crazy stuff people have laying around but I read about people using different kinds of hots, so I thought about things I have like that. A1 Steak Sauce (best stuff ever) came to my head. The way this work is, you get a table spoon and fill it with A1, then one by one drink 5-10 spoon fulls of it in a row very fast(between 5-8 sec between each spoon full), in about 3-7 min my throat stopped hurting. The measurements for this will probably varies for more or less server cases, and I don't suggest chugging the bottle. Only thing bad that happened is a bit of face sweating from the A1. ((And you'll have less sauce for your steak!!)) One more thing that could be important is, my A1 was cold, I know it adds something to it that I don't get from warm A1. So if your a steak guy, or a woman married to a steak guy, or a steak woman this is a great tasting cure for a sore throat.

7141	122	7986	AL from Kuching, Malaysia	2007-08-30 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I had read alot of positive feedback about using cayenne pepper powder to cure sore throat but unfortunately, in this part of the world, cayenne pepper isn't easy to find. So I thought I'd try a substitute instead-pure chilli powder which we keep an abundant supply because we cook curries so much.Then I decided to combine the other effective ingredient which have been also highly recommended by readers here-ACV! I had a terrible sore throat which was hurting very badly so I mixed a teaspoon of chilli powder with a 1/4 cup of ACV, then diluted the mixture with 1/2 cup of warm water and gargled 1/2 of it. The back of the throat burned a little but I didn't make much out of it. Then I rinsed my mouth and drank some water before going to bed.It didn't seem any better immediately after but the next morning , when I woke up, the pain in the throat was gone although I still felt as if a cough was still going to come up.I gargled the mixture again throughout the day, about 2 hourly and by evening, the sore throat was totally gone. I tried it with my children, aged 4 -13 and it worked for all of them too. Although my 4- year old felt it was too hot for her, she quickly took a chip of ice to cool her throat down. I must also add, it will not work if it's only done once a day-it will only be effective if it's gargled at least 3-4 hourly and for a very bad sore throat, every 2 hours.

7143	122	7988	Sam from Ewa Beach, Hawaii	2007-03-21 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Been using hot peppers for ever, but I just take a very small bite of Tai, Jalpeno, Habanero or whatever hot pepper I have on hand. Your saliva starts to flow like crazy but then just swallow very slowly, letting your choice of pepper ease down the throat. Don't choke and I can eat unusually hot food I am told. But it works like a charm within hours it you can handle the heat.
7144	122	7989	Sara from Des Moines, Iowa	2011-11-01 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	What I do, is I take a cup of boiling hot water let it cool a little, but while it is cooling I take a little slice of lemon and squeeze some juice out of it. Then stir in raw honey, after my tea is to my "darkness" of choosing I sit outside on cool fall nights and drink my tea slowly. And you **might** be thinking "But doesn't the cold make your cold worse?" Actually it helps me because I absolutely see no help in being stuck in the air that has been polluted by my sickness.

I'm 11 weeks pregnant so I unfortunately can't take a lot of medicines. So almost every website I went to said to drink hot tea with lemon and honey. I have been drinking this for 3 days, even trying to change the amount of lemon and honey I put in it and the level of hot I can stand. My throat is still just as sore and wasn't even relieved for a couple minutes. I'm sure it works great for some people but I have not had good luck with it.

Doing this regularly once or twice a week may help prevent a sore throat. 8 to 10 oz. water with one lemon squeezed in the water. Drink this with a straw. The lemon may eat the enamel off your teeth so use the straw. If your throat is scratchy do this. Do it at the onset of a sore throat and use 600 to 900 mg of garlic tablets. I use 1200mg and some time 2000mg. Wala your cured of your sore throat. If you do this before you get this you can prevent it.

Normally, by this time (several days later), I would have a raging sinus infection. But, as soon as I was home, I took the 2 t. Sea salt/lemon juice (with a dash of baking soda) and water as described. Slept pretty well that night, and have repeated the solution for 3 days now, feeling improvement each day. Today I not only feel recovered but also energized. My question is how often is it safe to do this on a regular basis? Once or twice a day? Once a week?

7155	123	8000	Barb from Aberdeen, WA	2009-05-07 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	When you gargle with Listerine for a sore throat, try this: when you are done gargling, let just a SMALL amount of the Listerine go down your throat. In this way, the Listerine reaches any germs that are a little farther down your throat, where gargling can't reach. I have tried this several times, and if you do it about three times a day, as long as your throat is sore, it will relieve it. It's also important to do all the other good things too, though, such as getting extra rest, drinking liquids, etc.

7176	124	7042	Nettle from London, England	2011-06-27 00:00:00	BETTER BUT NOT CURED	2	0	I was in such a state the other day with severe earache and sore throat. Never experienced such pain in my life. Have avoided antibiotics for 15 years but in my mad state of pain and fear, started taking amoxillin and ear sprays the other day. My stomach started hurting, had diarrhoea and I somehow felt I was making a mistake taking the AB.

Then add about half a cup of milk, heat to just below boiling point, and drink the mixture slowly, while hot. I also supplement this treatment by inhaling steam and keeping a hot water bottle on my head, throat or chest. I used to have colds that lasted two weeks; now I can get over them within three days.

Mix 1/2 teaspoon of salt with 1 teaspoon of turmeric and couple of drops of water to make this into paste. Wrap cotton wool around your finger or toothbrush and put the paste on the cotton wool and try and paint the inside of your throat as deep down the throat as possible.

If you take a pea-sized amount of Vick's Vaporub with a glass of water right before you go to bed when you feel your throat starting to get sore, etc., and you'll wake up feeling great. If it starts to come back the next evening, take another. But be careful only to take a small amount. Also, I keep mine jar in the freezer so it's easier to swallow. Whenever I do this, I NEVER get sick.

7188	125	8016	Kiwi6262 from Cullman, Al	2009-11-01 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	My 5 year old had such a bad sore throat that he was nearly in tears for several hours, so I was desperate. After reading the suggestions and things that have worked for other people, I decided to try out the apple cider vinegar, honey, lemon in warm water. Only problem was, I only had artificial lemon juice, white vinegar, and yellow syrup, but like I said, I was desperate! So! I warmed some water, put in a TBS of artificial lemon juice, a TBS of white vinegar, and 2 TBS of yellow syrup and tasted it to make sure it wasn't horrible (my son is 5 after all, and reasoning with him to drink something awful just because it will make him feel better isn't really an option!) and it tasted fine. I gave it to him and before he had half the cup drank he gave it back to me and said "Good job Mommy! It worked! I'm all better now!" I'd say that's the best testamonial you could get!

7191	125	8019	Ryan Preston from Leicester, England, UK	2007-11-09 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I can't really give much of a different song here, but what I done to cure my unbearable sore throat and runny nose (I'm still doing it) is by mixing up a concoction of malt vinegar (ACV is hard to get here), honey, lemon juice and water. That, within the last 10 mins of commencing this note has soothed my throat a lot. Now, to cure the runny noise, I made myself hot tea (NO MILK) and added honey and lemon juice, I mixed, then drank whilst it was hot. The runny nose problem is virtually abundant. And the sore throat should be, too. So... hot water, lemon juice, vinegar and honey do the trick!

7194	125	8022	Elizabeth from Orangeville, Canada	2007-11-30 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I mix salt, black pepper and vinegar together. The salt helps to dry up phlegm, the black pepper appears to cling to lose phlegm and pulls it out and the vinegar appears to kill the germs. Mix together in a strength you can handle (you can mix in warm water if vinegar is too strong) and gargle about a half a cup for the first time then again before bed or if throat bothers you during the day. It's a very old remedy my mom used on me as a child.
7195	125	8023	Lim from Singapore	2012-05-26 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	The simple cure that worked for me is as follows:- Just break up a Vitamin C tablet into smaller pieces and put one small piece on the tongue. Slowly suck it like a sweet. You will feel relief. Repeat that periodically when necessary. After a few times, your throat would not be painful anymore.
7196	125	7243	Anonymous	2006-04-20 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Water! It helps keep your throat moist. Keep water at your bedside for when you wake up and whenever your throat is feeling dry, drink water.
7197	125	8024	Kate from Toronto, Ontario	2008-12-04 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	The best remedy I know for sore throat is Drambuie. It's a Scottish liquer made with malt whiskey and spiced honey, and is 40%. Other similarly strong alcohols might help, but I have never tried them. Weak alcoholic drinks do NOT work. Just one small sip always provides immediate relief for myself and all my family. If the liquid doesn't seem to touch the particular spot in your throat, I like to gargle just a little bit. I know it sounds gross, and please remember this is a liquer, so you only want a sip and not a whole mouthful. If the sore throat comes back, two or three more sips throughout the day might be necessary. I have never had to use it more often than this. Of course I don't think I need to mention that this isn't for kids as the taste is very strong and could upset sensitive stomachs. Also, just a warning, that a 375ml bottle here in Canada will cost you about $25. This bottle will however last you a VERY long time. If you don't want to fork out that much, there are always small sample size bottles available too. Honestly though, this has worked in my family for the past 20 years at least.
7198	125	8025	Fred from MB, South Carolina	2007-02-14 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I first tried the hot water with Cayenne Pepper,and to no avail it did not work as expected it did however excite other sensory cells in which resulted in desensitizing the sore throat,I then moved to Cayenne Pepper in Apple Cider Vinegar,in which again failed. So I thought I would try the lemon in which did seem to help a small amount,I tried the Pineapple Juice in which seemed to have subsided the pain much better. I also tried using salt in hot water for several days,in which resulted little to no change. There are two types of sore throats one that is Bacterial,and the other is Viral,while Bacterial can often bee cured by antibiotics,Viral sore throats cannot be,and often require a running of its course,it is important to note that Viral sore throats are caused by the bodies immune system during its war, your anti bodies essentially destroy the cold virus via chemical acid,by spraying acid onto the cold virus it also destroys healthy cells in its process,burning the lining in the throat,that is why vitamin c is important in fighting a cold,because the acidity level needs to be high to fight off the cold virus. however a sudden change in your acid levels in your throat can actually irritate the sore throat and make it worse,such as a sudden use of a Zinc supplement. While some success has been met using salt in a hot water mixture,this success is due to the fact that the sensory cells in the throat has already been damaged to a point whereas the salt water actually cures the lining the same process that is used to cure meats,on the other hand a sore throat in which has not been damaged much may get worse using salt,or eating foods such as a salty soup,and crackers. Now comes another fact if the sore throat is Bacterial certain foods should be avoided such as sweets,and high fructose corn syrups,as the bacteria will thrive on such simple sugars. Cough drops should be avoided,as well as certain mouth washes such as plaque controls,or other washes that contain sugars. The best remedy for a sore throat is a good white whiskey,stay away from the dark. Gargle with the whiskey a few times a day until the sore throat subsides,then have you a shot once or twice a week to help stay off any future occurrences.

7205	125	8032	Paul from Freeport, Maine	2011-10-20 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I've been building my own house for several years and have been "burning the candle on both ends" for too long. I'm on the edge of exhaustion much of the time and have become susceptable to sore throats. I learned that if I keep a keen sense on how my throat is feeling, I can stop a developing sore throat by taking a 50mg zinc tablet, chew it a bit to break it up (or you crush it between two spoons), take a sip of water and gargle it well to coat the entire throat and swallow it. Kills the virus in the throat every time. The only time it doesn't work on the first dose is when I don't pay attention to the discomfort and wait a day or two. Then it takes two or three applications (over a day) for a day or two to kill the virus in the throat. The longer you wait to apply the zinc after first feeling the throat getting sore, the more doses it will take. This works folks! I RARELY ever have an oncoming sore throat develop into anything worse anymore. The zinc kills the virus it in its tracks. Absolute truth.

So, I've had strep throat for about 4 days now, and it is NOT getting better. I was looking online for anything that would help, and i came across the cayanne pepper trick. I ran upstairs to see if i had any, and to my dismay, i did not. what i did have though, was franks red hot sauce, containing, vinegar, water, and of coarse cayanne peppers. I just carry a bottle around, and drink one swig an hour. and honestly, i have no pain whatsoever, my throat feels fine. its not so much a cure, as much as its instant pain relief. its amazing. it legitimatly works better then any medicine ive ever seen. try it out if you dont believe me.
7209	126	7980	Katheryn from Columbia, South Carolina	2008-02-24 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I was rather skeptical about using any of these remedies... I sucked it up and took a glass of hot water with some generic hot sauce and a little honey. After just the first sip my sore throat that has been around for over 2 weeks was much lighter. I will continue to use til it is gone completely. Thank you so much!
7210	126	7981	Tamairo from Milwaukee, United States	2008-02-12 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I read through a wealth of information here. I was very skeptical about using tobasco sauce! It is just way too hot. However, I didn't have any in my kitchen anyway. If I did, I probably would have used it as bad as my throat was hurting. I ended up using a derivative of the tobasco sauce. I got the Louisiana Hot Sauce from my cupboard. I read the ingredients and Cayenne Pepper was in there. So I figured, what the hell! Most people on here have said that it works, I am in so much pain! I thought, well, my throat feels so bad, it can't do anything but get better from this. I took a small 4 ounce plastic cup. I put about six shakes of hot sauce, and the rest hot water. I gargled with this solution for about 5-6 gargles in a row. The first few times, my throat felt like it was on fire. I thought that the fire department would need to be called. I was looking for a fire extinguisher! Anyway, to my surprise, this remedy actually gave me alot of relief! I couldn't believe it! I am going to see how I feel in the morning. I was just about to go to the ER. I just decided to search the net first and found this site. Awesome guys! Thanks for your helpful suggestions! I feel alot better.
7211	126	7982	Christopher from Springfield, MO	2008-02-12 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	One more thing: if you're using milk to unbond the capsicum from your mouth and stop the burning, I'd advise just rinsing with it and not swallowing. You should avoid eating dairy products as much as possible while fighting a cold because they cause your body to secrete more mucous and phlegm--which means that you'll actually be making your congestion worse.
7212	126	7983	Chris from Springfield, MO	2008-02-11 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I've found another good vehicle for the cayenne sore throat cure is bouillon broth. It ads to the beneficial effects of the hotness the other beneficial effects of salt exposure. I don't have any cayenne or Tabasco on hand (and the weather is not such that I can easily get out and get them right now), but I have Sriracha, which is a hot pepper/garlic sauce I got from a local Oriental food market. I mixed a teaspoon or so of it with the beef bouillon (didn't really measure, just squirted a glob in that looked about that size), and it worked well.
7213	126	7984	Brandon from Pasadena, Maryland	2008-02-06 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Hello, today I got a bad sore throat and found this site. I'm only 15 so I don't have a lot of this crazy stuff people have laying around but I read about people using different kinds of hots, so I thought about things I have like that. A1 Steak Sauce (best stuff ever) came to my head. The way this work is, you get a table spoon and fill it with A1, then one by one drink 5-10 spoon fulls of it in a row very fast(between 5-8 sec between each spoon full), in about 3-7 min my throat stopped hurting. The measurements for this will probably varies for more or less server cases, and I don't suggest chugging the bottle. Only thing bad that happened is a bit of face sweating from the A1. ((And you'll have less sauce for your steak!!)) One more thing that could be important is, my A1 was cold, I know it adds something to it that I don't get from warm A1. So if your a steak guy, or a woman married to a steak guy, or a steak woman this is a great tasting cure for a sore throat.
7214	126	7985	Bob from Monroe, LA	2007-12-31 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I didn't have any Tabasco but I had some habanero sauce. I swallowed a spoon full and my sore throat ceased immediately. I'm sweating a little from the heat of the sauce but it is a welcome relief from my sore throat.
7215	126	7986	AL from Kuching, Malaysia	2007-08-30 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I had read alot of positive feedback about using cayenne pepper powder to cure sore throat but unfortunately, in this part of the world, cayenne pepper isn't easy to find. So I thought I'd try a substitute instead-pure chilli powder which we keep an abundant supply because we cook curries so much.Then I decided to combine the other effective ingredient which have been also highly recommended by readers here-ACV! I had a terrible sore throat which was hurting very badly so I mixed a teaspoon of chilli powder with a 1/4 cup of ACV, then diluted the mixture with 1/2 cup of warm water and gargled 1/2 of it. The back of the throat burned a little but I didn't make much out of it. Then I rinsed my mouth and drank some water before going to bed.It didn't seem any better immediately after but the next morning , when I woke up, the pain in the throat was gone although I still felt as if a cough was still going to come up.I gargled the mixture again throughout the day, about 2 hourly and by evening, the sore throat was totally gone. I tried it with my children, aged 4 -13 and it worked for all of them too. Although my 4- year old felt it was too hot for her, she quickly took a chip of ice to cool her throat down. I must also add, it will not work if it's only done once a day-it will only be effective if it's gargled at least 3-4 hourly and for a very bad sore throat, every 2 hours.

7217	126	7988	Sam from Ewa Beach, Hawaii	2007-03-21 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Been using hot peppers for ever, but I just take a very small bite of Tai, Jalpeno, Habanero or whatever hot pepper I have on hand. Your saliva starts to flow like crazy but then just swallow very slowly, letting your choice of pepper ease down the throat. Don't choke and I can eat unusually hot food I am told. But it works like a charm within hours it you can handle the heat.
7218	126	7989	Sara from Des Moines, Iowa	2011-11-01 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	What I do, is I take a cup of boiling hot water let it cool a little, but while it is cooling I take a little slice of lemon and squeeze some juice out of it. Then stir in raw honey, after my tea is to my "darkness" of choosing I sit outside on cool fall nights and drink my tea slowly. And you **might** be thinking "But doesn't the cold make your cold worse?" Actually it helps me because I absolutely see no help in being stuck in the air that has been polluted by my sickness.

I'm 11 weeks pregnant so I unfortunately can't take a lot of medicines. So almost every website I went to said to drink hot tea with lemon and honey. I have been drinking this for 3 days, even trying to change the amount of lemon and honey I put in it and the level of hot I can stand. My throat is still just as sore and wasn't even relieved for a couple minutes. I'm sure it works great for some people but I have not had good luck with it.

Just go to the drugstore and buy the brown bottle of Hydrogen Peroxide and gargle with it full strength... DO NOT SWALLOW. Rinse several times with plain tap water. NOT FOR CHILDREN since they could possibly swallow the peroxide. Note: The directions on the Hydrogen Peroxide bottle says it may be used as an oral rinse.
7224	126	7852	Dawn from Atlanta, Ga	2011-02-10 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I woke up 3 mornings gargling a sore throat. It was majorly sore, but I didn't want it to get any sorer. It was only sore on the right side. So, I came to my faithful and trusted site. I couldn't wait to try the peroxide in my ears. I poured a couple drops in the cap and drop it in my ear and went to bed. It did feel a little weird, but not painful at all. The next morning I got up and my throat wasn't sore AT ALL. It's been over a week now and I never got a cold. I shared this remedy with a cousin who was getting over a cold, but it was still lingering. She emailed me today and said "it worked like a charm"!!!! Thanks to EC and all of you for sharing and keeping us healthy!!
7225	126	7853	Chrissy from Akron, Ohio	2010-01-29 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have had a sore throat for a week now. I put the 3% Hydrogen Peroxide (no mix)onto some Qtips and then rubbed it onto my tonsils. It completely got rid of the white pus sacs on my tonsils and was foaming. The Qtips actually had pus all over them..Kinda gross but it worked!! I IMMEDIATELY felt better and am able to swallow now without pain..What a miracle that stuff is! I would rate the pain before using the peroxide, a 10, after using it a 1. Slight discomfort but not really noticeable. I also did it until I saw no more pus on my tonsil or on the qtips. Use a clean qtip each time. Also, this can cause you to gag..so be careful with that. Thanks so much for this website!

The size of my tonsils measure to golf balls and the are now covered with white pus! This afternoon my mother suggested that I try her old wives tale of gargling with peroxide! I poured a small amount into a cup, approx the amount that would be used to gargle with and instantly It foamed, i began to gag as huge amounts of mucus and began to pour out! I then rinsed with water a few times. As the afternoon has passes I still continue to have to spit out mucus but it seems to be doing the trick.

I am on an antibiotic for sinus infection, but I have NEVER had such a sore throat. My DR. recommended throat spray which works for about 2 mins... ibubrofen, nope, cough drops, nope. I just found this remedy and actually have it in the house. I felt instantly better, still hurts but I will continue to gargle with it. It even says it on the bottle for oral rinse.

This definitely cut the icky taste of the peroxide. It didn't give immediate relief, but my sore throat was cured overnight. I will definitely be using this again!

Tried ACV first, and got some relief, but only about an hour's worth. I read all of the posts on cayenne and decided that one was next, but did not have any of the pepper. I remembered that it is in hot sauce, so i mixed up a tea. I boiled some water, and then added a shake or two of ground ginger, a tablespoon of hot sauce, a tsp of oregano, a tablespoon of honey, tablespoon of lemon juice and a green tea teabag. I let it steep for about 5 minutes. What i had was a concoction... "liquid fire" and about 30 minutes after drinking, no sore throat and nasal passages were draining. The next morning i was surprised to still be clear. Thanks for posting this idea.

Just started getting a horrible sore throat about 3 hours ago and I HATE getting sick, especially right before the holidays. I decided to pull out the heavy guns and made a hot tea of about 1/4 tsp. ground cayenne, three shots of Tabasco, 3 tbspns maple syrup, and 1 tbspn champagne vinegar (I didn't have any ACV). As I sit here typing I am sipping this spicy brew and the left side of my throat is no longer hurting. The right side is still tender but I think it is getting better. I also have clear sinus passages and I am coughing up lots of clear sticky phlegm. I intend to keep drinking this stuff until I am better. I really think it is working. ---NEW CAYENNE FAN

At first sign of a sore throat, I place one or two between my cheek and teeth after crunching them just a little bit. This numbs the throat and kills the germs that cause the problem. If I awaken at night, even one clove can save me from a sore throat coming on, if I place it in my mouth in this manner. I had to tell my family, 'No, it does not stain my teeth. No, I never choke on it, and yes, I do sleep on my back, etc.'

7232	127	7918	Trish from Kansas City, MO	2007-12-11 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Hi, I wanted to quickly comment on some of the 'nay' responses to the cayenne pepper remedy. For those of you who are burning the living you-know-what out of your mouths, try lessening the amount of pepper taken in one dose and take it more often. A few people have mentioned taking lemon juice, maple syrup, and the pepper with water. This is actually a fasting recipe as well (the fast Beyonce was one to lose weight for 'Dream Girls'). The proper measurements are 10oz. distilled water, 2 tablespoons FRESH lemon juice, 2 T. maple syrup (Grade B, and organic is best if you can afford it), and a PINCH of cayenne pepper(about 1/8 teaspoon or even less). The water should be heated before mixing in the ingredients. Try drinking this mixture throughout the day. It takes time but the soreness in your throat will eventually subside. It you drink it throughout the day and eat nothing, you will also start to detox your body and lose some water weight overnight as well, given you have no major health problems. Also, another trick (if you throat has just started hurting)...try mixing 6 to 8 drops of hydrogen peroxide in a large glass of distilled/purified (not spring) water and drinking several times throughout the day. Usually my sore throats start to feel relief with in 15 minutes to half an hour after the first glass. If it's pesky, keep drinking. If you have something bad already, like strep, you may need to just go to the doctor. It may be too late for the peroxide to relieve pain, but it may lessen the the time you are sick. Try an alternative healer, for those of you not wanting to take drugs (and I don't blame you). Also, someone commented, saying that antibiotics was the only cure. Be careful, if you choose to take antibiotics make sure you take a good round of probiotics, for a month at least, afterward. Otherwise you are just killing off the good guys in your gut and setting yourself up for future problems.

I did this when I drank my coffee this morning and it is a God-Send ! Just sprinkle some cayenne pepper in your coffee and drink it! It makes the flavor of the coffee WONDERFUL and it is fantastic for your throat! This website is a pure blessing from God. Thank you to all who come here and share their experiences!
7234	127	7920	Sabrina from Canada	2007-05-04 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	An oldie but a goodie, my recipe is a little different. Mix vinegar of any variety with a spoonful of cayenne, a spoonful of licorice root, and a small amount of RAW honey. Drink it back - the sore throat will go away shortly. The raw honey is great because honey has natural antiseptic properties, and it makes the mix a little easier to drink!
7235	127	7921	Janeene from Saginaw, MI	2006-12-28 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have used this remedy for YEARS and can tell you, IT WORKS!! The only thing that I do different is, I add an equal amount of ground ginger along with the cayenne pepper into a cup of HOT water and allow it to steep with a lid on the cup for 5 minutes. Then allow it to cool to a comfortable temperature (or add a little cold water) and gargle. This may seem time consuming when you are in a lot of pain but it is worth the wait! Allowing it to steep like that makes sure the spices are at their best. The cayenne brings the blood to the throat helping circulation for those well needed "healing soldiers" and the ginger calms the throat and helps reduce the swelling. I sometimes drink this as a tea on those cold winter nights to help me stay warm! For you hunters out there...sprinkle cayenne in your socks to keep your feet warm out in the field. The moisture from your feet activates the heat of the pepper keeping those toes TOASTY!!! CAYENNE PEPPER IS THE BEST!

Still here this morning. Went online and found the mixture of 1/2 tsp of each: cayenne, salt, lemon juice in 1/2 cup of water. WOW. First gargle took the sore throat away! Will repeat today until this evening. I did swallow the second gargle and tolerated it well.

I mixed 1tsp cayenne, 1tsp salt, 1tsp lemon in a cup of water. Gargled for a couple of minutes, then I spit out the concoction but swallowed what was left in my mouth. Took a couple of minutes but it feels literally 100% better. Thanx ya'll
7238	127	7924	Nick from Poughkeepsie, NY	2007-10-21 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	A good remedy for sore throat is a hot bowl of chicken broth. One bowl is usually enough but for more serious strep throat two. chicken noodle soup works best for kids.
7239	127	7925	Essma from Dallas, TX	2009-03-13 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	My in laws are from Pakistan; many of their home remedies are similar to those in Ayurveda, and my mother in law's suggestions are unbelievably effective for the kids' ailments. So to soothe a sore throat (not a cure but will help you sleep and function), keep a clove or a few cloves (the spice) in the back of your mouth. You can bite it a few times to release the oils. Cloves have numbing properties so maybe that is how it works. Anyway, everyone i have shared this with has found relief for their sore throats/night coughs with this!
7240	127	7926	Avidcooker from Raleigh, NC	2007-12-23 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Yes, I am a true believer of holistic medicine and cloves definately work great for sore throats. When I feel the sore throat coming on, I suck on 2 cloves, biting on them just a little so that the oil form within gets released. I keep it in my mouth for q hour or so, 3 times a day. And the sore throat is gone within 12 hours. I've never had to go to a doctor for this condition even as a child... the cure is there right at home.

I was searching for a remedy for sore throat and tried cloves. After sucking/chewing 4-5 cloves in a day, my throat felt MUCH better and the next day it was totally gone!! I was so GRATEFUL dat I didnt need antibiotics 4 it!
7242	127	7928	Donny from Miami, FL	2007-05-31 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I rarely get sick. I am in pretty good shape, don't always exercise like I should, but I don't allow myself to get out of shape. However, every now and then I do catch something. Caught a sore throat the other day and instead of buying medicine from the store, I decided to go natural on the problem. I'm drinking only citrus juices (grapefruit is my preference), water, and tea with lemon and honey. For on the go relief I may take an aspirin (no more than 3 in 24 hours), and I take a couple whole cloves (not garlic, the spice), nibble on them a bit, and hold them between my teeth/cheeks and just suck on them. A little bitter, but instantly numbs the sore throat, and on the plus side, keeps your breath fresh and smelling like cinnamon! Excellent strategy, and I WILL use it in the future.

7244	127	8034	Susan from Glendale, CA, USA	2009-01-04 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I've somehow managed to catch a horrible cold and have battled a sore throat for 2 days now. I have absolutely NO tolerance for pain, so I've been miserable. I've been using cayenne pepper and ACV as both a gargle and added to hot water to sip on constantly, but it only gives little to temporary relief. I decided to try some coconut oil in some pineapple tea that I had (hoping deep down it resembled a pina colada!) I saw that EVCO wasn't listed as a remedy for cold or sore throats, really, but I decided to give it a shot. Wow, was it soothing! The horrible thing about sore throats is how dry and scratchy the throat gets which makes the pain ten times worse... but the coconut oil lubed everything up so nicely that it doesn't hurt half as bad! I have no idea how long this will last, but I'll take what relief I can get! I did have a lot of success with EVCO after having a strange sinus infection last year at this time that made all the glands in my head so swollen. After trying everything and going to the doctor who gave me no-good antibiotics, I gave EVCO a shot, and within one day my glands had gone down, my head and decongested and I felt better. I love this stuff. I just wish I liked the taste better!

7249	127	8039	Sarah from Didcot, Oxfordshire, UK	2006-09-12 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I think that bacteria/viruses in my throat need sugar and peace and quiet to multiply. I stop supplying sugar by ceasing to eat sugary food/drink. This means no cough sweets! I physically remove the bacteria/viruses from my throat by frequently eating non-sugary food. They are then being taken down to my stomach where they cause no trouble! I focus on drinking water, not abrasive teas or coffees. I find eating apples very helpful too, especially when I get woken up in the night with a tickly cough! Take an apple to bed and just reach out for it each time you wake. Now I just get a sore throat/cold and then it heals under a week, no more hacking coughs for weeks afterwards. Best wishes.

Soak your feet in a tub of water with about a cup of epsom salts, hot as you can stand for about 20 mins. Then dry your feet and put on two pairs of socks, woollen socks if you have them over a pair of thin cotton socks and go to bed. Each time I've done this my sore throat is gone by morning. Persistent sore throats can return though, so it's good to do the cayenne pepper gargle/ACV cayenne tea during the day if it comes back, and the espsom salt footbath at night before bed.

Then add about half a cup of milk, heat to just below boiling point, and drink the mixture slowly, while hot.

Mix 1/2 teaspoon of salt with 1 teaspoon of turmeric and couple of drops of water to make this into paste. Wrap cotton wool around your finger or toothbrush and put the paste on the cotton wool and try and paint the inside of your throat as deep down the throat as possible.

If you take a pea-sized amount of Vick's Vaporub with a glass of water right before you go to bed when you feel your throat starting to get sore, etc., and you'll wake up feeling great. If it starts to come back the next evening, take another. But be careful only to take a small amount. Also, I keep mine jar in the freezer so it's easier to swallow. Whenever I do this, I NEVER get sick.

After reading the suggestions and things that have worked for other people, I decided to try out the apple cider vinegar, honey, lemon in warm water. Only problem was, I only had artificial lemon juice, white vinegar, and yellow syrup, but like I said, I was desperate! So! I warmed some water, put in a TBS of artificial lemon juice, a TBS of white vinegar, and 2 TBS of yellow syrup and tasted it to make sure it wasn't horrible (my son is 5 after all, and reasoning with him to drink something awful just because it will make him feel better isn't really an option!) and it tasted fine. I gave it to him and before he had half the cup drank he gave it back to me and said "Good job Mommy! It worked! I'm all better now!" I'd say that's the best testamonial you could get!

Add lime juice and honey. Combine by pouring this mixture from one cup into another, over and over, until mixture gets ginger-coloured (Steeping). 5) Sip on/drink this hot mixture as much as you could safely bear, WITH the grated ginger pulp. Tip: Let grated ginger settle a bit in throat area while drinking Notes: 1)Check to see if you are allergic to any of the ingredients listed before atempting 2) Fresh ginger and lime are useful because the beneficial Enzymes are said to be more abundant than powder forms 3) Use this tea/mixture at least twice daily (morning/evening) for 3 days and you will notice the difference before the 3 days ..got this from a website who's owner went to India and was told of this tea there, after having horible sore throat. Take care

I keep some ginger in my purse and chew on pieces of it all through the day. It's not very pleasant as it burns (especially if you already have a sore throat) but it works like a miracle! I've recommended this to some of my friends and it worked wonders for them too!

Just take so regular tea, and mix in lemon juice, some ginger, a dash of salt, a 2 or 3 teaspoons of pickle brine, cayenne pepper. I prefer on the side to have a cup of milk and/or water, to help with the taste and cut down on the taste. This is basically a mix of a lot of little cures I have tried. I got fed up with them and just started trying my own things, good luck.

Add these to a cup and pour boiling water over it. Let it steep, then drink. You really have to like ginger as it is super spicy hot. This helps my sore throat and nausea from all the mucus settling in my stomach. The added alcohol helps me go to sleep.
7278	129	7958	Laura from Massachusetts	2006-02-06 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I have to voice my opinion about the ginger tea with lemon! I found it to be very soothing, but I also find that I need to drink a lot of it. I will have the tea for about 2-3 days, 2-3 times a day. It does make me feel better, unless I've let my cold go for a few days without treatment, in that case, it will just soothe the symptoms while I am drinking it, but not relieve the cold completely. In those cases, I've normally had to take OTC meds, in conjunction. I also like zinc in lozenge form with lemon, or zicam (zinc in liquid gel form that is placed directly in the nasal passages), but you have to be careful with these as they can cause nausea if you take too much. Just follow the instructions on the package, it does work!

Slice up some fresh ginger root and boil it in a few cups of water, along with some fresh garlic, lemon, cayenne pepper and honey. Let the mixture cool a bit, then strain and enjoy. Another variation is to use oranges and cranberries, as opposed to the lemon.

I use Grapefruit Seed Extract now - known for killing the strep virus (and I had strep 6 times in one year and hated taking antibiotics) ... so I was on a quest. Anyways, GSE turns out to be a Godsend, kills internal bugs without biotics... great thing! Brush teeth to kill sore throats - or gargle, if more severe. Great thing is, it numbs it. Raw throat, however, can't seem to snuff. What do you to when your 7 year old has a terrible raw throat and can't swallow? Darn!

Before I tried this method, swallowing saliva was painful, but after the pain is much more bearable. This is also a convenient way because I found this site at school, and didn't have the leisure to get warm tea.

Both of us tried many remedies and since my girl is just 6 months old we did not know what to do. I tried after reading from the site cayenne- gargling, saltwater gargling, Tabasco sauce, etc. Finally, one thing worked for both of us!! I used Haritaki powder(available in almost all Indian stores). It is a very cheap powder($2.39 or so). It is very bitter powder. Biological name is called Terminalia chebulam (Black Myrobalan in English). Black Myrobalan powder is also available in some health stores but Indian stores offers best price. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haritaki

I was reading all the responses to your Cayenne cure for sore throats and I wanted to share a cure I learned also works well: you can chew a spoonful of honeycomb. Not just plain honey, but honey still packaged the way bees make it, with the beeswax. I read of this cure in an old book of folk remedies from Vermont (when I lived in Wisconsin). I didn't believe it but a while after reading it I began to catch a cold, with my throat all scratchy and aching so it hurt to swallow. I tried this remedy, and what do you know -- after a minute or so of chewing my throat was clear and pain-free. That nice effect lasted about half an hour, then the symptoms began to return -- so I tried a second time and that cleared it up for good. I was amazed how well it worked. I'm also happy to know a second remedy to try too, since it is not so easy to get honeycomb over here in Togo. Honey is also a great for healing burns and infections -- if you search online you'll find plenty of information.

When I'm in a situation where I can't gargle, I take a teaspoon of honey for instant relief for a sore throat. The effects generally last for several hours.

Living in the south we are more prone to allergy related problems and believe in grandmas remedies. My cure for sinus and sore throat problems is a spoonful of horseradish, coated with Lousianna Hot Sauce (made from cayenne pepper) and take it till you feel better. I usually eat about 3 heaping spoonfuls every hour till it is gone. Usually gone by the next day.

After coming to this site I tried hotsauce and lemon juice I meant to gargle but swallowed accidently. For about 30 seconds I was in the most god awful pain ever, then I hacked up a chunk of phlegm the size of a quarter that looked like it had a tiny bit of blood it it. I was worried, but I coughed up a smaller bit that didn't have any, and hadn't seen blood since, so I think it was just from violent coughing.

7297	130	8045	Kat from Vancouver, WA	2009-05-30 00:00:00	NAY	1	0	I tried gargling warm/hot saltwater, with as much salt mixed in as I could get to dissolve. It helped soothe my sore throat for less than five minutes. Then I tried gargling pickle juice and had about the same results. Finally I tried gargling hydrogen peroxide and the foaming made me throw up, which just made my throat hurt worse. It did seem to help clear out my sinuses a bit, but whether that was from throwing up or the hydrogen peroxide, I don't know. All the gargling seems to have aggravated the problem a bit too. I think I'll just stick to cough drops...
7298	130	8046	corie from turnersville, nj usa	2009-01-30 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	a glass of hot water and salt helped my sore throat. i just gargled it until the glass was empty. i did this repeatedly every few hours or so. i also found that hot tea with honey and lemon works but not as long as the salt water. the tea just tastes better. vitamin water helps keep the sore throat away for a couple of hours. i would drink a bottle of it over the course of 1 to 2 hours after doing one of the remedies. ricolas dont work that well but they do help coughs and sometimes congestion it really depends on the flavor you get. for post coughing pain i tried this really weird concoction but it worked. i used skim milk (don't use any other milk but skim or you will get flem) and a pinch of cinnamon. it helped with the pain you get after you have been coughing for a few hours.

We always have tincture of myrrh around the house, since it's useful for many, many things. Here's how I do it: I take a plastic cup (3oz.) and put as much tincture in it as I think I can stand. Then I dilute it a bit with some warm water, and gargle, repeating until everything in the cup is gone. Then, I rinse *just* my mouth, NOT my throat, with regular water. This leaves a bit of an aftertaste and you might produce excess saliva for a couple of minutes, but it helps quite a bit with the pain and can also help kill whatever infection might be causing the sore throat.

I tried e.v. Olive oil this morning b/c I read that sesame & sunflower can leave you with a sore throat and I didn't want to aggravate the one I already had. So I did a tablespoon of EVOO & swished for 10 minutes... and, remarkably, my sore throat was gone! Incredible! I hope it helps my gums too.
7302	130	8050	Dimetri from Toronto, Ontario, Canada	2009-09-21 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	For a sore throat I have found that Oil of Oregano works like a miracle cure. Apply one to three drops on the tongue, close your mouth and allow your saliva to wash it back towards your throat. You will feel a choking/burning sensation for about 10 to 20 seconds which will soon subside. Repeat as needed throughout the day. Usually by the second or third day, my symptoms have gone. During this time, stay away from processed foods and especially white sugar & sugar filled foods. Those little bacteria and viruses love that stuff. And remember to keep yourself hydrated - lots of water, not soda, not beer, not alcohol, not flavoured water, not crystal light, just H2O. Usually about 2 to 3 litres depending on your weight.

It is super concentrated oil derived from oregano leave. If you research it is well know for its antibacterial properties. Apparently, and I believe it, it has the same antibacterial properties as lysol minus the toxicity. I mixed two drops from 1:1 concentration formula (per the bottles instructions) to one ounce of water and a table spoon of honey. I gargled a bit then swallowed as it is perfectly safe to drink. And it doesn't taste that bad either. The results were immediate. My sore throat went away in 5 minutes. I thought maybe I would have to follow-up but no it was gone in 5 minutes. My throat was bad but not as bad as I have had as I get strept throat on occasion were I can't even eat because it hurts to swallow. I see lots of people writing on the effects of cayenne pepper and am surprised noone has commented on oil of oregano. Try it it works!

Oil of oregano - the king of herbs, books have been written about it, as well as many studies and years of tests. I myself have used it for many years with stellar results and also raves from thankful patients. A couple drops sublingually held for thirty seconds will get a bit intense. This will get it into your blood stream asap. Your sore throat will be gone in less than fifteen minutes.
7306	130	8054	Jo-jo74 from Philadelphia, Pa	2012-06-30 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Oregano is a good option for sore throats. However, it's important to dilute it with something other than water, like honey or coconut oil. This way, there is less chance of throat irritation. (Oregano oil is strong! ) Option #2- Tamari soy sauce worked well as a gargle as an alternative to ACV or pickle juice.

It lasted at least 1/2 an hour, but that's longer than any cough drops, tea, honey, or apple cider vinegar that I've tried. Half an hour isn't that long, but most of the scratchiness and soreness went down and continued for awhile after. It's a lot of calories, but if you're sick you probably won't be eating much, so won't be a problem. This is probably a good solution to do when your throat hurts really bad, between cough drops or tea, etc.

You can get bottled Pear Juice in the baby-food section of a grocery store. OR you can still find some pears canned in their own actual pear juice. (The juice from pears canned in "corn syrup", will not work.) It has to be real pear juice. This is a lot easier for kids to swallow, then something like cayenne pepper. I don't know why it works. I just know it does. I doubt its killing the bacteria/virus causing the sore throat. But it does get rid of the pain for a while.

7311	131	8059	John from Richmond, VA	2008-03-02 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Pineapple helped to get rid of my white tongue. I'm not sure why, I think it has an enzyme or chemical in it that causes the tongue coating to dissolve. Eat at least a couple of bites once or twice a day. This helps, but is not enough alone. The proper oral routine is necessary too. I found that brushing twice a day with a sls-free toothpaste allowed my tongue to shed normally and remain pink and healthy, which wouldn't happen with regular toothpaste. And don't use mouthwash or brush or scrape your tongue. Oil pulling once a day will help as well.

While drinking a few glasses of red wine (i think very cheap and bad quality as the taste was very sour and it came from China) i felt some tinkling on my tongue and a bit burning. The tinkling was as if small blisters burst open. The next day the white coating was dark purple from the wine, and after brushing the colour was still here. One or two days later i looked at my tongue and it was pink! Never seen this in my life before, and not justa little pink. But fresh, smooth, clean, the best and nicest tongue i have ever seen. Like photoshopped! Now after 9 weeks it is coming back a little but, not too much. I wish i could find that wine again! Anybody here has an idea about what in this red wine might have caused this amazing result?

I noticed since I got ill I had really bad coating, dehydration, and worse breath than usual. I am so glad I found this site. I have tried all kinds of over the counter remedies, never worked. I first gargled with sea salt and water for about five minutes because the coating was quite thick. Then I spit, put sea salt directly on my tongue and tried to leave it on there for at least five minutes coating thoroughly. I then spit that out and brushed with the leftover remnants of salt, rinsed. Then I did a paste of sea salt, baking soda, and hydrogen peroxide and brushed tongue, teeth, roof of mouth and gums. Lo and Behold! It worked! I've never, ever had a pink tongue and it is pink and I can feel my tastebuds for once! Woo Hoo. I finished by rinsing with hydrogen peroxide, then flushing mouth out with water. So far so good. I am also going to try the charcoal to help with digestive tract and the glycerin w/peppermint oil as a way to leave my mouth with a fresh taste after doing the salt/baking soda treatment. Good luck you guys! This worked for me and I've never ever had a pink, pink tongue. Wow. Thanks Earthclinic.

7328	131	8076	Rick from West Valley, Utah	2008-07-24 00:00:00	NAY	1	0	Didn't work for me. Tried brushing with salt and rinsing gargling with salt water. No effect.
7329	131	8077	Mike from Virginia Beach, VA	2008-07-17 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Thank you so much! my tongue was so white it made me sick to look at it. After just one use of salt on my tooth brush my tongue was pink and healthy. I'm now proud to show off my tongue ring lol.
7330	131	8078	Amanda  from Northfield, Ohio	2008-05-20 00:00:00	NAY	1	0	White Tongue Remedies: I just wanted you to know I tried the salt water thing. The white on my tongue did not come off. I am going to try the listerine next and I will let you know if that does not work. P.S. Brushing your tongue is usually not a good idea. You should check with your doctor first to find out if it is serious or not. Brushing your tongue with a serious tongue condition can pretty much make it worse or ruin your tongue for life.
7331	131	8079	FRED from MISSISSAUGA, ONT, CANADA	2008-04-30 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I tried the brushing with salted water and salt on my toothbrush,and presto my tongue turned pink again! of course it is a little hard to reach to the very back of the tongue without gagging but this remedy does really work!
7332	131	8080	Maria from Las Vegas, Nevada	2008-04-23 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I had a white tounge and tried a number of remedies on this site. I had a difficult time using the oil as suggested as it caused a gagging reflex and ultimatily did not work.....then I tried salt. After just one brushing of the tounge with the salt, it was pink and clean. I am thrilled. Thanks for the suggestion
7333	131	8081	BigS from Darlington, England	2008-02-05 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Using salt helps immediately. I was rather desperate to get rid of it however so I took the option of pouring about two teaspoons of salt into my mouth then brushed my tongue with that. To be honest I thought it wouldn't work but was stunned to see the difference. Thanks alot Miss.U
7334	131	8082	Miss.U from London, England	2007-12-30 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Firstly, put 1 spoon of salt in a cup then add water, they dip your tooth brush into it and brush your tounge, it might sting but then the pain and white will go. Or with the saty water put it in your mouth and hold it for thirty seconds on your tongue then gargle for thirty seconds then spit it out this should help. or a very strange fast way is to hold salt on your tongue as long as possible but make sure all of it is spread on your tounge! Try these all they work!!!! Good Luck!
7335	131	8083	Anthony from London, Uk	2010-03-07 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	Hi, have had a coated tongue for years (33 yo) and don't know why. Brush it every night gargled, use salt, have a healthy diet blah blah blah. I've recently (2 months ago), having read of the dangers of parabens and Sodium Laurel Sulphate, stopped using all cleansing products apart from a little, food grade shower gel on armpits, groin and bum. I extended this to toothpaste 2 days ago, I now use one with aloevera and teatree oil in. My tongue has gone clean! Also, in this time, my very mild but persistent 'bacne' has cleared up, my forehead bumps have gone down, and I'm regrowing little hairs on my, sadly, thinning pate. I think I was allergic to the chemicals.
7336	131	8084	Katie from Atlanta, Georgia	2007-05-17 00:00:00	YEA	0	0	I brush my teeth 7  times a day, by the way I never have cavities. This amount of brushing still never stops the film --- however, when i was drinking 3/4 gal of water a day (there was about 3 months of my life that I did this) the film totally disappeared! it's true.
